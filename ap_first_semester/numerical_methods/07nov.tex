\section{Sorting}

Useful for astrophysics since we often deal with large files.

\paragraph{Bubble sort}
We loop through the file, and swap each pair if it is not ordered.

It is \(O(n^2)\) in general.

\paragraph{Selection sort}
We look for the minimum and put it at the beginning, then scan the remaining array.

It is \(O(n^2)\) in general.

\paragraph{Quicksort}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We pick an element, the \emph{pivot};
    \item we reorder the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it;
    \item we do this recursively to the subarrays to the left and right of the pivot.
\end{enumerate}

It is \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, \(O(n \log n )\) usually.

\paragraph{Merge sort}

We divide the array into small subarrays, and merge them to produce larger subarrays.

It is \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, \(O(n \log n )\) usually.
