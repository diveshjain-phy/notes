In the second part of the course we will look at a certain dataset in groups, analyze it, research it (with a couple weeks or a month to do it); then do a presentation for around 10 minutes each.

The exam can be done even the last lecture: we just have to notify him a week in advance.

We will analyze data either from CHANDRA or NUSTAR.

Exercise: best fit in the 3 to \SI{79}{keV} and plot spectrum \(E^2 \dv{N}{E}\).
Verify that the parametrs of the centroid of the iron line and the temperature are independently derived.
Verify that the iron line is statistically significant. 

Steppar: to create a contour plot.
