Orbital motion: under Newtonian gravity we have \(T = 2 \pi \sqrt{a^{3} / \mu }\), where \(a\) is the semimajor axis of the ellipse and \(\mu = G (m_1 + m_2 )\). 

The inner Van Allen (not Eddie Van Halen!) bands reach down to \SI{200}{km} over the Earth's surface, especially over the South Atlantic: the region is about \(0 \divisionsymbol \SI{60}{\degree} \) W longitude and \(2 \divisionsymbol \SI{50}{\degree} \) S longitude. 

Satellites shut down when passing there. Astronauts in the ISS get \emph{shooting stars} in their eyes. 

The Lagrange points are \(L1\) between Sun and Earth, \(L2\) behind the Earth, \(L3\) on the other side of the Sun, \(L4\) and \(L5\) on the vertices of equilateral triangles with two vertices on S and E.
