The result comes about from the following code: \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from astropy.cosmology import Planck15 as cosmo
import numpy as np
import astropy.units as u
from astropy.constants import codata2018 as ac
H0 =u.littleh *100 * u.km/u.s / u.Mpc
rhoC = 3 * H0**2 / (8 * np.pi * ac.G)
(rhoC * cosmo.Ob0 / ac.m_p).to(u.cm**-3 * u.littleh**2)
\end{lstlisting}^^E^^L
