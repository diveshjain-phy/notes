	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter {LCDM} model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (theta\_*) now known to 0.03\%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the {LCDM} model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

	abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter Λ{CDM} cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted “base Λ{CDM}” in this paper). From the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} temperature data combined with {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Mpc{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, a matter density parameter Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with {\textless}i{\textgreater}n{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of {\textless}i{\textgreater}τ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from {WMAP} polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-{GHz} polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base Λ{CDM} in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} observations with other astrophysical data we find {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.23 {eV}. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with {\textbar} Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textbar} {\textless} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base Λ{CDM} we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0.002{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless} 0.11, consistent with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 2013 results and consistent with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of {BICEP}2, Keck Array, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ({BKP}) data. Adding the {BKP} {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0.002{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a {\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}i/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}φ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) ∝ {\textless}i{\textgreater}φ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} potential. The addition of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to {\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = −1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} base Λ{CDM} cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} results for base Λ{CDM} are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the {JLA} sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base Λ{CDM} cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base Λ{CDM} cosmology provides an excellent description of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {CMB} observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

This is achieved by performing a scaling analysis of this quantum geometric tensor in the vicinity of the critical points. In this way most of the previous results are understood on general grounds and new ones are found. We show that criticality is not a sufficient condition to ensure superextensive divergence of the geometric tensor, and state the conditions under which this is possible. The validity of this analysis is further checked by exact diagonalization of the spin-1/2 {XXZ} Heisenberg chain.},

	abstract = {The violation of a Bell inequality not only attests to the nonclassical nature of a system but also holds a very unique status within the quantum world. The amount by which the inequality is violated often provides a good benchmark on how a quantum protocol will perform. Acquiring images of such a fundamental quantum effect is a demonstration that images can capture and exploit the essence of the quantum world. Here, we report an experiment demonstrating the violation of a Bell inequality within observed images. It is based on acquiring full-field coincidence images of a phase object probed by photons from an entangled pair source. The image exhibits a violation of a Bell inequality with S = 2.44 ± 0.04. This result both opens the way to new quantum imaging schemes based on the violation of a Bell inequality and suggests promise for quantum information schemes based on spatial variables.

	shorttitle = {H0LiCOW {XIII}. A 2.4\% measurement of \$H\_\{0\}\$ from lensed quasars},
	abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant (\$H\_\{0\}\$) and other cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of six gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays. All lenses except the first are analyzed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology, we find \$H\_\{0\} = 73.3\_\{-1.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.7\}\$, a 2.4\% precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of \$H\_\{0\}\$ from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in \$3.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ observations of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and {CMB} analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in \$5.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ {CMB} determinations of \$H\_\{0\}\$ in flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM}. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including {CMB} observations from \$Planck\$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with \$Planck\$. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our \$H\_0\$ inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on \$H\_\{0\}\$ ranges from \${\textbackslash}sim73\$-\$78{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

Very low amplitude density and temperature perturbations produce small gravitational effects, leading to an anisotropy that is a combination of temperature fluctuations at the surface of last scattering and gravitational redshifts both at last scattering and along the path to the observer. All of the primary anisotropy can be handled by linear perturbation theory, which allows a very accurate calculation of the predicted anisotropy from different models of the Universe.},

	abstract = {A nonrelativistic potential theory for gravity is considered which differs from the Newtonian theory. The theory is built on the basic assumptions of the modified dynamics, which were shown earlier to reproduce dynamical properties of galaxies and galaxy aggregates without having to assume the existence of hidden mass. The theory involves a modification of the Poisson equation and can be derived from a
Lagrangian. The total momentum, angular momentum, and (properly defined) energy of an isolated system are conserved. The center-of-mass
acceleration of an arbitrary bound system in a constant external gravitational field is independent of any property of the system. In other words, all isolated objects fall in exactly the same way in a constant external gravitational field (the weak equivalence principle is satisfied). However, the internal dynamics of a system in a constant external field is different from that of the same system in the absence of the external field, in violation of the strong principle of
equivalence. These two results are consistent with the phenomenological requirements of the modified dynamics. A toy relativistic theory is sketched which has a nonrelativistic limit satisfying the requirements of the modified dynamics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06209},
	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the {CMB} anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM}" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} model. Combining with {BAO} we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textless} 0.12\${eV}. The {CMB} spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) {BAO} data.
