  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission \emph{Planck\emph{ observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the \emph{Planck\emph{ nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted “base ΛCDM” in this paper). From the \emph{Planck\emph{ temperature data combined with \emph{Planck\emph{ lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, \emph{H\emph{\textsubscript{0\textsubscript{ = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{Mpc\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{, a matter density parameter Ω\textsubscript{m\textsubscript{ = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with \emph{n\emph{\textsubscript{s\textsubscript{ = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the \emph{Planck\emph{ temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \emph{τ\emph{ = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining \emph{Planck\emph{ observations with other astrophysical data we find \emph{N\emph{\textsubscript{eff\textsubscript{ = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value \emph{N\emph{\textsubscript{eff\textsubscript{ = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ \emph{m\emph{\textsubscript{\emph{ν\emph{\textsubscript{ {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | Ω\textsubscript{\emph{K\emph{\textsubscript{ | {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of \emph{r\emph{\textsubscript{0.002\textsubscript{{$<$} 0.11, consistent with the \emph{Planck\emph{ 2013 results and consistent with the \emph{B\emph{-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and \emph{Planck\emph{ (BKP) data. Adding the BKP \emph{B\emph{-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of \emph{r\emph{\textsubscript{0.002\textsubscript{ {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a \emph{V\emph{(\emph{φ\emph{) ∝ \emph{φ\emph{\textsuperscript{2\textsuperscript{ potential. The addition of \emph{Planck\emph{ polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining \emph{Planck\emph{ data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to \emph{w\emph{ = −1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit \emph{Planck\emph{ base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The \emph{Planck\emph{ results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the \emph{Planck\emph{ CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

By a purely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it, motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible. The resulting distortion is reminiscent of the ``warp drive'' of science fiction. However, just as it happens with wormholes, exotic matter will be needed in order to generate a distortion of spacetime like the one discussed here.},

  abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

  abstract = {The grand challenges of contemporary fundamental physics---dark matter, dark energy, vacuum energy, inflation and early universe cosmology, singularities and the hierarchy problem---all involve gravity as a key component. And of all gravitational phenomena, black holes stand out in their elegant simplicity, while harbouring some of the most remarkable predictions of General Relativity: event horizons, singularities and ergoregions. The hitherto invisible landscape of the gravitational Universe is being unveiled before our eyes: the historical direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration marks the dawn of a new era of scientific exploration. Gravitational-wave astronomy will allow us to test models of black hole formation, growth and evolution, as well as models of gravitational-wave generation and propagation. It will provide evidence for event horizons and ergoregions, test the theory of General Relativity itself, and may reveal the existence of new fundamental fields. The synthesis of these results has the potential to radically reshape our understanding of the cosmos and of the laws of Nature. The purpose of this work is to present a concise, yet comprehensive overview of the state of the art in the relevant fields of research, summarize important open problems, and lay out a roadmap for future progress.},

  abstract = {A future detection of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) with GW experiments is expected to open a new window on early universe cosmology and on the astrophysics of compact objects. In this paper we study SGWB anisotropies, that can offer new tools to discriminate between different sources of GWs. In particular, the cosmological SGWB inherits its anisotropies both (i) at its production and (ii) during its propagation through our perturbed universe. Concerning (i), we show that it typically leads to anisotropies with order one dependence on frequency. We then compute the effect of (ii) through a Boltzmann approach, including contributions of both large-scale scalar and tensor linearized perturbations. We also compute for the first time the three-point function of the SGWB energy density, which can allow one to extract information on GW non-Gaussianity with interferometers. Finally, we include non-linear effects associated with long wavelength scalar fluctuations, and compute the squeezed limit of the 3-point function for the SGWB density contrast. Such limit satisfies a consistency relation, conceptually similar to what found in the literature for the case of CMB perturbations.},

  abstract = {The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) contains a wealth of information on astrophysical and cosmological processes. A major challenge of upcoming years will be to extract the information contained in this background and to disentangle the contributions of different sources. In this paper we provide the formalism to extract, from the correlation of three signals in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), information about the tensor three-point function, which characterizes the non-Gaussian properties of the SGWB. This observable can be crucial to discriminate whether a SGWB has a primordial or astrophysical origin. Compared to the two-point function, the SGWB three-point function has a richer dependence on the gravitational wave momenta and chiralities. It can be used therefore as a powerful discriminator between different models. For the first time we provide the response functions of LISA to a general SGWB three-point function. As examples, we study in full detail the cases of an equilateral and squeezed SGWB bispectra, and provide the explicit form of the response functions, ready to be convoluted with any theoretical prediction of the bispectrum to obtain the observable signal. We further derive the optimal estimator to compute the signal-to-noise ratio. Our formalism covers general shapes of non-Gaussianity, and can be extended straightaway to other detector geometries. Finally, we provide a short overview of models of the early universe that can give rise to a non-Gaussian SGWB.},

  abstract = {A nonrelativistic potential theory for gravity is considered which differs from the Newtonian theory. The theory is built on the basic assumptions of the modified dynamics, which were shown earlier to reproduce dynamical properties of galaxies and galaxy aggregates without having to assume the existence of hidden mass. The theory involves a modification of the Poisson equation and can be derived from a
Lagrangian. The total momentum, angular momentum, and (properly defined) energy of an isolated system are conserved. The center-of-mass
acceleration of an arbitrary bound system in a constant external gravitational field is independent of any property of the system. In other words, all isolated objects fall in exactly the same way in a constant external gravitational field (the weak equivalence principle is satisfied). However, the internal dynamics of a system in a constant external field is different from that of the same system in the absence of the external field, in violation of the strong principle of
equivalence. These two results are consistent with the phenomenological requirements of the modified dynamics. A toy relativistic theory is sketched which has a nonrelativistic limit satisfying the requirements of the modified dynamics.},

  abstract = {The modified newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm of Milgrom can boast of a number of successful predictions regarding galactic dynamics; these are made without the assumption that dark matter plays a significant role. MOND requires gravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic regime where dynamical accelerations are small. So far relativistic gravitation theories proposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of general relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or violated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an \textbackslash{}textit\{a priori\} vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory which resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a scalar field and a 4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of its free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic dynamics with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are small. We calculate the \$\textbackslash{}beta\$ and \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ PPN coefficients showing them to agree with solar system measurements. The gravitational light deflection by nonrelativistic systems is governed by the same potential responsible for dynamics of particles. To the extent that MOND successfully describes dynamics of a system, the new theory's predictions for lensing by that system's visible matter will agree as well with observations as general relativity's predictions made with a dynamically successful dark halo model. Cosmological models based on the theory are quite similar to those based on general relativity; they predict slow evolution of the scalar field. For a range of initial conditions, this last result makes it easy to rule out superluminal propagation of metric, scalar and vector waves.},

  abstract = {Within the standard effective field theory of General Relativity, we show that the speed of gravitational waves deviates, ever so slightly, from luminality on cosmological and other spontaneously Lorentz-breaking backgrounds. This effect results from loop contributions from massive fields of any spin, including Standard Model fields, or from tree level effects from massive higher spins \$s \textbackslash{}ge 2\$. We show that for the choice of interaction signs implied by S-matrix and spectral density positivity bounds suggested by analyticity and causality, the speed of gravitational waves is in general superluminal at low-energies on NEC preserving backgrounds, meaning gravitational waves travel faster than allowed by the metric to which photons and Standard Model fields are minimally coupled. We show that departure of the speed from unity increases in the IR and argue that the speed inevitably returns to luminal at high energies as required by Lorentz invariance. Performing a special tuning of the EFT so that renormalization sensitive curvature-squared terms are set to zero, we find that finite loop corrections from Standard Model fields still lead to an epoch dependent modification of the speed of gravitational waves which is determined by the precise field content of the lightest particles with masses larger than the Hubble parameter today. Depending on interpretation, such considerations could potentially have far-reaching implications on light scalar models, such as axionic or fuzzy cold dark matter.},

A closed universe can provide a physical explanation for this effect, with the Planck CMB spectra now preferring a positive curvature at more than \$99 \textbackslash\%\$ C.L. Here we further investigate the evidence for a closed universe from Planck, showing that positive curvature naturally explains the anomalous lensing amplitude and demonstrating that it also removes a well-known tension within the Planck data set concerning the values of cosmological parameters derived at different angular scales. We show that since the Planck power spectra prefer a closed universe, discordances higher than generally estimated arise for most of the local cosmological observables, including BAO. The assumption of a flat universe could, therefore, mask a cosmological crisis where disparate observed properties of the Universe appear to be mutually inconsistent. Future measurements are needed to clarify whether the observed discordances are due to undetected systematics, or to new physics, or simply are a statistical fluctuation.},

(2) The energy or mass of light is subject to gravitation in the same way as ordinary matter. If the law of gravitation is strictly the Newtonian law, this leads to an apparent displacement of a star close to the sun’s limb amounting to 0"·87 outwards. (3) The course of a, ray of light is in accordance with Einstein’s generalised relativity theory. This leads to an apparent displacement of a star at the limb amounting to 1"·75 outwards. In either of the last two cases the displacement is inversely proportional to the distance of the star from the sun’s centre, the displacement under (3) being just double the displacement under (2).},

His general theory of relativity further taught us that spacetime is not just a stage on which dynamics takes place, but is a participant: The field equation of general relativity connects matter dynamics to the curvature of spacetime. Curvature is responsible for gravity, carrying us beyond the Newtonian conception of gravity that had been in place for the previous two and a half centuries. Much research in gravitation since then has explored and clarified the consequences of this revolution; the notion of dynamical spacetime is now firmly established in the toolkit of modern physics. Indeed, this notion is so well established that we may now contemplate using spacetime as a tool for other science. One aspect of dynamical spacetime -- its radiative character, ``gravitational radiation'' -- will inaugurate entirely new techniques for observing violent astrophysical processes. Over the next one hundred years, much of this subject's excitement will come from learning how to exploit spacetime as a tool for astronomy. This article is intended as a tutorial in the basics of gravitational radiation physics.},

Recent research on this effect has clarified the physical origin and the interpretation of this gravitational phenomenon in terms of conserved charges at null infinity and "soft theorems." In this paper, we describe a more general class of effects than the gravitational wave memory that are not necessarily associated with these charges and soft theorems, but that are, in principle, measurable. We shall refer to these effects as persistent gravitational wave observables. These observables vanish in non-radiative regions of a spacetime, and their effects "persist" after a region of spacetime which is radiating. We give three examples of such persistent observables, as well as general techniques to calculate them. These examples, for simplicity, restrict the class of non-radiative regions to those which are exactly flat. Our first example is a generalization of geodesic deviation that allows for arbitrary acceleration. The second example is a holonomy observable, which is defined in terms of a closed loop. It contains the usual "displacement" gravitational wave memory; three previously identified, though less well known memory effects (the proper time, velocity, and rotation memories); and additional new observables. Finally, the third example we give is an explicit procedure by which an observer could measure a persistent effect using a spinning test particle. We briefly discuss the ability of gravitational wave detectors (such as LIGO and Virgo) to measure these observables.},

We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity.

  abstract = {Stellar insolation has been used as the main constraint on a planet's habitability. However, as more Earth-like planets are discovered around low-mass stars (LMSs), a re-examination of the role of tides on the habitability of exoplanets has begun. Those studies have yet to consider the misalignment between a planet's rotational axis and the orbital plane normal, i.e. the planetary obliquity. We apply two equilibrium tide theories to compute the obliquity evolution of terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones around LMSs. The time for the obliquity to decrease from an Earth-like obliquity of 23.5 deg to 5 deg, the 'tilt erosion time', is compared to the traditional insolation habitable zone (IHZ) as a function of semi-major axis, eccentricity, and stellar mass. We also compute tidal heating and equilibrium rotation caused by obliquity tides. The Super-Earth Gl581d and the planet candidate Gl581g are studied as examples for tidal processes. Earth-like obliquities of terrestrial planets in the IHZ around {$<$}0.25 solar mass (M\_sun) stars are eroded in {$<$}0.1 Gyr. Only terrestrial planets orbiting stars with masses {$>$}0.9 M\_sun experience tilt erosion times larger than 1 Gyr throughout the IHZ. Terrestrial planets in the IHZ of stars with masses {$<$}0.25 M\_sun undergo significant tidal heating due to obliquity tides. The predictions of the two tidal models diverge significantly for e{$>$}0.3. In our two-body simulations, Gl581d's obliquity is eroded to 0 and its rotation period reached its equilibrium state of half its orbital period in {$<$}0.1 Gyr. Tidal surface heating on the putative Gl581g is {$<$}150 mW/m\^2 as long as its eccentricity is {$<$}0.3. Obliquity tides modify the concept of the habitable zone. Tilt erosion of terrestrial planets orbiting LMSs should be included by atmospheric modelers. Tidal heating needs to be considered by geologists.},

  abstract = {The influential theorems of Hawking and Penrose demonstrate that spacetime singularities are ubiquitous features of general relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity. The utility of classical general relativity in describing gravitational phenomena is maintained by the cosmic censorship principle. This conjecture, whose validity is still one of the most important open questions in general relativity, asserts that the undesirable spacetime singularities are always hidden inside of black holes. In this Letter we reanalyze extreme situations which have been considered as counterexamples to the cosmic censorship hypothesis. In particular, we consider the absorption of fermion particles by a spinning black hole. Ignoring quantum effects may lead one to conclude that an incident fermion wave may over spin the black hole, thereby exposing its inner singularity to distant observers. However, we show that when quantum effects are properly taken into account, the integrity of the black-hole event horizon is irrefutable. This observation suggests that the cosmic censorship principle is intrinsically a quantum phenomena.},

  abstract = {Advances in our understanding and the modeling of stellar core-collapse and supernova explosions over the past 15 years are reviewed, concentrating on the evolution of hydrodynamical simulations, the description of weak interactions and nuclear equation of state effects, and new insights into the nucleosynthesis occurring in the early phases of the explosion, in particular the neutrino-p process. The latter is enabled by the proton-richness of the early ejecta, which was discovered because of significant progress has been made in the treatment of neutrino transport and weak interactions. This progress has led to a new generation of sophisticated Newtonian and relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in spherical symmetry. Based on these, it is now clear that the prompt bounce-shock mechanism is not the driver of supernova explosions, and that the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism can produce explosions without the aid of multi-dimensional processes only if the progenitor star has an ONeMg core inside a very dilute He-core, i.e., has a mass in the 8--10 solar mass range. Hydrodynamic instabilities of various kinds have indeed been recognized to occur in the supernova core and to be of potential importance for the explosion. Neutrino-driven explosions, however, have been seen in two-dimensional simulations with sophisticated neutrino transport so far only when the star has a small iron core and low density in the surrounding shells as being found in stars near 10--11 solar masses. The explosion mechanism of more massive progenitors is still a puzzle. It might involve effects of three-dimensional hydrodynamics or might point to the relevance of rapid rotation and magnetohydrodynamics, or to still incompletely explored properties of neutrinos and the high-density equation of state.},

This notation can encourage and clarify the use of characteristic functions and Kronecker deltas in sums and integrals. The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial coefficients. Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses and read "n choose k", Stirling numbers of the first kind should be written on two lines in brackets and read "n cycle k", while Stirling numbers of the second kind should be written in braces and read "n subset k". (I might say "n partition k".) The written form was first suggested by Imanuel Marx. The virtues of this notation are that Stirling partition numbers frequently appear in combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional relations similar to those satisfied by binomial coefficients.},

  abstract = {NGC6240 is a well-studied nearby galaxy system in the process of merging. Based on optical, X-ray, and radio observations, it is thought to harbor two active nuclei We carried out a detailed optical 3D spectroscopic study to investigate the inner region of this system in connection with existing MERLIN and VLBA data. We observed NGC6240 with very high spatial resolution using the MUSE instrument in the Narrow-Field Mode with the four-laser GALACSI adaptive optics system on the ESO VLT under seeing conditions of 0.49 arcsec. Our 3D spectra cover the wavelength range from 4725 to 9350 AA at a spatial resolution of \textasciitilde{}75 mas. We report the discovery of three nuclei in the final state of merging within a region of only 1 kpc in the NGC6240 system.Thanks to MUSE we are able to show that the formerly unresolved southern component actually consists of two distinct nuclei separated by only 198 pc. In combination with Gaia data we reach an absolute positional accuracy of only 30 mas that is essential to compare optical spectra with MERLIN and VLBA radio positions. The verification and detailed study of a system with three nuclei, two of which are active and each with a mass in excess of \$9\textbackslash{}times10\^\{7\} M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$, is of great importance for the understanding of hierarchical galaxy formation via merging processes since multiple mergers lead to a faster evolution of massive galaxies in comparison to binary mergers. So far it has been suggested that the formation of galactic nuclei with multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is expected to be rare in the local universe.Triple massive black hole systems might be of fundamental importance for the coalescence of massive black hole binaries in less than a Hubble time leading to the loudest sources of gravitational waves in the millihertz regime.},

  abstract = {The Alcubierre warp drive allows a spaceship to travel at an arbitrarily large global velocity by deforming the spacetime in a bubble around the spaceship. Little is known about the interactions between massive particles and the Alcubierre warp drive, or the effects of an accelerating or decelerating warp bubble. We examine geodesics representative of the paths of null and massive particles with a range of initial velocities from -c to c interacting with an Alcubierre warp bubble travelling at a range of globally subluminal and superluminal velocities on both constant and variable velocity paths. The key results for null particles match what would be expected of massive test particles as they approach +/- c. The increase in energy for massive and null particles is calculated in terms of v\_s, the global ship velocity, and v\_p, the initial velocity of the particle with respect to the rest frame of the origin/destination of the ship. Particles with positive v\_p obtain extremely high energy and velocity and become "time locked" for the duration of their time in the bubble, experiencing very little proper time between entering and eventually leaving the bubble. When interacting with an accelerating bubble, any particles within the bubble at the time receive a velocity boost that increases or decreases the magnitude of their velocity if the particle is moving towards the front or rear of the bubble respectively. If the bubble is decelerating, the opposite effect is observed. Thus Eulerian matter is unaffected by bubble accelerations/decelerations. The magnitude of the velocity boosts scales with the magnitude of the bubble acceleration/deceleration.},

  abstract = {The violation of a Bell inequality not only attests to the nonclassical nature of a system but also holds a very unique status within the quantum world. The amount by which the inequality is violated often provides a good benchmark on how a quantum protocol will perform. Acquiring images of such a fundamental quantum effect is a demonstration that images can capture and exploit the essence of the quantum world. Here, we report an experiment demonstrating the violation of a Bell inequality within observed images. It is based on acquiring full-field coincidence images of a phase object probed by photons from an entangled pair source. The image exhibits a violation of a Bell inequality with S = 2.44 ± 0.04. This result both opens the way to new quantum imaging schemes based on the violation of a Bell inequality and suggests promise for quantum information schemes based on spatial variables.
We report the violation of a Bell inequality within full-field coincidence images of a phase object probed by entangled photons.

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash{}Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash{}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash{}Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash{}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash{}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash{}tau = 0.054\textbackslash{}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash{}theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash{}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash{}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash{}Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash{}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash{}sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash{}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash{}rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash{}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash{}sum m\_\textbackslash{}nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter LCDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (theta\_*) now known to 0.03\%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the LCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

  abstract = {Early dark energy (EDE) that behaves like a cosmological constant at early times (redshifts \$z\textbackslash{}gtrsim3000\$) and then dilutes away like radiation or faster at later times can solve the Hubble tension. In these models, the sound horizon at decoupling is reduced resulting in a larger value of the Hubble parameter \$H\_0\$ inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We consider two physical models for this EDE, one involving an oscillating scalar field and another a slowly-rolling field. We perform a detailed calculation of the evolution of perturbations in these models. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo search of the parameter space for the EDE parameters, in conjunction with the standard cosmological parameters, identifies regions in which \$H\_0\$ inferred from \{\textbackslash{}it Planck\} CMB data agrees with the SH0ES local measurement. In these cosmologies, current baryon acoustic oscillation and supernova data are described as successfully as in \textbackslash{}LCDM, while the fit to \{\textbackslash{}it Planck\} data is slightly improved. Future CMB and large-scale-structure surveys will further probe this scenario.},

  abstract = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant (H\_0) from 3.3\% to 2.4\%. Improvements come from new, near-infrared observations of Cepheid variables in 11 new hosts of recent SNe\textasciitilde{}Ia, more than doubling the sample of SNe\textasciitilde{}Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance for a total of 19; these leverage the magnitude-z relation based on 300 SNe\textasciitilde{}Ia at z{$<$}0.15. All 19 hosts and the megamaser system NGC4258 were observed with WFC3, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors. Other improvements include a 33\% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC4258, more Cepheids and a more robust distance to the LMC from late-type DEBs, HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. H\_0 from each is 72.25+/-2.51, 72.04+/-2.67, 76.18+/-2.37, and 74.50+/-3.27 km/sec/Mpc, respectively. Our best estimate of 73.24+/-1.74 km/sec/Mpc combines the anchors NGC4258, MW, and LMC, and includes systematic errors for a final uncertainty of 2.4\%. This value is 3.4 sigma higher than 66.93+/-0.62 km/sec/Mpc predicted by LambdaCDM with 3 neutrinos with mass 0.06 eV and the Planck data, but reduces to 2.1 sigma relative to the prediction of 69.3+/-0.7 km/sec/Mpc with the combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO, suggesting systematic uncertainties in CMB measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck and H\_0 at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early Universe in the range of Delta N\_eff=0.4-1. We anticipate significant improvements in H\_0 from upcoming parallax measurements.},

We assume two distinct hot regions based on two clear pulsed components in the phase-folded pulse-profile data; we explore a number of forms (morphologies and topologies) for each hot region, inferring their parameters in addition to the stellar mass and radius. For the family of models considered, the evidence (prior predictive probability of the data) strongly favors a model that permits both hot regions to be located in the same rotational hemisphere. Models wherein both hot regions are assumed to be simply connected circular single-temperature spots, in particular those where the spots are assumed to be reflection-symmetric with respect to the stellar origin, are strongly disfavored. For the inferred configuration, one hot region subtends an angular extent of only a few degrees (in spherical coordinates with origin at the stellar center) and we are insensitive to other structural details; the second hot region is far more azimuthally extended in the form of a narrow arc, thus requiring a larger number of parameters to describe. The inferred mass M and equatorial radius R eq are, respectively, and , while the compactness is more tightly constrained; the credible interval bounds reported here are approximately the 16\% and 84\% quantiles in marginal posterior mass.},

  abstract = {The problem of stationary, spherically symmetric accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole is discussed here with the use of a formalism which is completely consistent with Einstein's General theory of Relativity.

The transfer of heat is a significant part of this process, however treating it without approximations has proven difficult.
Here I explore the adiabatic case first; then I consider a more general case by assuming that all the heat transfer happens through electromagnetic radiation.
For the latter I apply the PSTF formalism which, roughly speaking, while still being relativistic allows for the decomposition of the radiation into its first moments: energy density and flux.

The numerical analysis of the differential equations the problem can be reduced to shows a bimodal behaviour: a branch of solutions has a much higher efficiency (ratio of luminosity to accretion rate) than another.

In order to treat this problem, first I briefly recall the formalism of general relativity; then I treat the basics of the relativistic formulation of the fluid dynamical equations, including the relativistic version of the Second Principle of thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {In astroparticle physics, an Urca process is a reaction which emits a neutrino and which is assumed to take part in cooling processes in neutron stars and white dwarfs.  The process was first discussed by George Gamow and Mário Schenberg while they were visiting a casino named Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro.  As Gamow recounts in his autobiography, the name was chosen in part to commemorate the gambling establishment where the two physicists had first met, and "partially because the Urca Process results in a rapid disappearance of thermal energy from the interior of a star, similar to the rapid disappearance of money from the pockets of the gamblers on the Casino de Urca." In Gamow's South Russian dialect, urca (Russian: урка) can also mean a robber or gangster.The direct Urca processes are the simplest neutrino-emitting processes and are thought to be central in the cooling of neutron stars. They have the general form

where B1 and B2 are baryons, ℓ is a lepton, and νl (and νl) are (anti-)neutrinos. The baryons can be nucleons (free or bound), hyperons like Λ, Σ and Ξ, or members of the Δ isobar. The lepton is either an electron or a muon.
The Urca process is especially important in the cooling of white dwarfs, where a lepton (usually an electron) is absorbed by the nucleus of an ion and then convectively carried away from the core of a star.  Then, a beta decay occurs.  Convection then carries the element back into the interior of the star, and the cycle repeats many times.  Because the neutrinos emitted during this process are unlikely to be reabsorbed, this is effectively a cooling mechanism for white dwarfs.The process can also be essential in the cooling of neutron stars. If a neutron star contains a central core in which the direct Urca-process is operative, the cooling timescale shortens by many orders of magnitude.},

In this paper we unify these two approaches showing that the underlying mechanism is the critical singular behavior of a complex tensor over the Hamiltonian parameter space. This is achieved by performing a scaling analysis of this quantum geometric tensor in the vicinity of the critical points. In this way most of the previous results are understood on general grounds and new ones are found. We show that criticality is not a sufficient condition to ensure superextensive divergence of the geometric tensor, and state the conditions under which this is possible. The validity of this analysis is further checked by exact diagonalization of the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain.},

  abstract = {The formation and evolution of galaxies is highly dependent on the dynamics of stars and gas, which is governed by the underlying law of gravity. To investigate how the formation and evolution of galaxies takes place in Milgromian gravity (MOND), we present full hydrodynamical simulations with the Phantom of Ramses (POR) code. These are the first-ever galaxy formation simulations done in MOND with detailed hydrodynamics, including star formation, stellar feedback, radiative transfer and supernovae. These models start from simplified initial conditions, in the form of isolated, rotating gas spheres in the early Universe. These collapse and form late-type galaxies obeying several scaling relations, which was not a priori expected. The formed galaxies have a compact bulge and a disk with exponentially decreasing surface mass density profiles and scale lengths consistent with observed galaxies, and vertical stellar mass distributions with distinct exponential profiles (thin and thick disk). This work thus shows for the first time that disk galaxies with exponential profiles in both gas and stars are a generic outcome of collapsing gas clouds in MOND. These models have a slight lack of stellar angular momentum because of their somewhat compact stellar bulge, which is connected to the simple initial conditions and the negligible later gas accretion. We also analyse how the addition of more complex baryonic physics changes the main resulting properties of the models and find this to be negligibly so in the Milgromian framework.},

All lenses except the first are analyzed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, we find \$H\_\{0\} = 73.3\_\{-1.8\}\^\{+1.7\}\$, a 2.4\% precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of \$H\_\{0\}\$ from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in \$3.1\textbackslash{}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in \$5.3\textbackslash{}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ CMB determinations of \$H\_\{0\}\$ in flat \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from \$Planck\$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with \$Planck\$. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our \$H\_0\$ inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on \$H\_\{0\}\$ ranges from \$\textbackslash{}sim73\$-\$78\textasciitilde\textbackslash{}mathrm\{km\textasciitilde{}s\^\{-1\}\textasciitilde{}Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

  abstract = {Like all true stars, massive stars are gravitationally confined thermonuclear reactors whose composition evolves as energy is lost to radiation and neutrinos. Unlike lower-mass stars (M≲8M⊙), however, no point is ever reached at which a massive star can be fully supported by electron degeneracy. Instead, the center evolves to ever higher temperatures, fusing ever heavier elements until a core of iron is produced. The collapse of this iron core to a neutron star releases an enormous amount of energy, a tiny fraction of which is sufficient to explode the star as a supernova. The authors examine our current understanding of the lives and deaths of massive stars, with special attention to the relevant nuclear and stellar physics. Emphasis is placed upon their post-helium-burning evolution. Current views regarding the supernova explosion mechanism are reviewed, and the hydrodynamics of supernova shock propagation and “fallback” is discussed. The calculated neutron star masses, supernova light curves, and spectra from these model stars are shown to be consistent with observations. During all phases, particular attention is paid to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Such stars are capable of producing, with few exceptions, the isotopes between mass 16 and 88 as well as a large fraction of still heavier elements made by the r and p processes.},

Here we report that the brightest supernovae in the modern Universe arise from collisions between shells of matter ejected by massive stars that undergo an interior instability arising from the production of electron-positron pairs. This "pair instability" leads to explosive burning that is insufficient to unbind the star, but ejects many solar masses of the envelope. After the first explosion, the remaining core contracts and searches for a stable burning state. When the next explosion occurs, several solar masses of material are again ejected, which collide with the earlier ejecta. This collision can radiate 1E50 erg of light, about a factor of ten more than an ordinary supernova. Our model is in good agreement with the observed light curve for SN 2006gy and also shows that some massive stars can produce more than one supernova-like outburst.},

This is also widely believed to be true in general relativity (GR), and the Birkhoff theorem is often invoked to support this analogy between NG and GR. Here we show that such an understanding of the Birkhoff theorem is incorrect and leads to erroneous calculations of light deflection and delay time through matter. The correct metric, matching continuously to the location of an external observer, is determined both by the enclosed mass and mass distribution outside. The effect of the outside mass is to make the interior clock run slower, i.e., a slower speed of light for external observer. We also discuss the relations and differences between NG and GR, in light of the results we obtained in this Lettework. Finally we discuss the Generalized Shapiro delay, caused by the outside mass, and its possible laboratory test.},

This resolution may soon enable measurements of the black hole “shadow” size and asymmetry, predicted to be ≈50 and ≲3 μas, respectively. Measurements that depart from these values could indicate a violation of the “no-hair theorem.” However, refractive scattering by the turbulent ionized interstellar medium distorts the image of Sgr A*, affecting its apparent size and asymmetry. In this paper, we present a general analytic approach to quantify the expected image wander, distortion, and asymmetry from refractive scattering. If the turbulence in the scattering material of Sgr A* is close to Kolmogorov, we estimate the mean refractive image wander, distortion, and asymmetry to be 0.53, 0.72, and 0.52 μas at 230 GHz. However, alternative scattering models with flatter power spectra can yield larger values, up to 2.1, 6.3, and 5.0 μas, respectively. We demonstrate that these effects can be reduced by averaging images over multiple observations. For a small number of observations, the effects of scattering can be comparable to or greater than those from black hole spin, and they determine a fundamental limit for testing general relativity via images of Sgr A*.},
