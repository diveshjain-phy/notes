\section*{Thu Oct 10 2019}

Today at 17 there is a colloquium at Aula Rostagni.

Next week, also at 17, there is a meeting at San Gaetano (for the general public).

We just had a Nobel prize in cosmology: he predicted the existence of the CMB, and two in astrophysics, they found the first exoplanet.

Send the professor an e-mail to get access to his Dropbox folder with many relevant texts.

We come back to the RW metric:

\begin{equation}
  \dd{s^2} = c^{2} \dd{t^{2}} - a^2(t) \qty(\frac{\dd{r^2}}{1-kr^2} + r^2 \dd{\Omega^2})\,,
\end{equation}
%
where \(k=0, \pm 1\) and \(r\) is the dimensionless comoving radius.

The distance can be calculated as:
%
\begin{equation}
  d_P (t) = a(t)\frac{r}{\sqrt{1-kr^2}}\,.
\end{equation}

We are allowed to consider radial trajectories, however this does not account for the fact that we cannot actually measure with a space-like measuring stick.

A better definition is
%
\begin{equation}
  d_P = a(t) \int_0^r \frac{\dd{\widetilde{r}}}{\sqrt{1-k \widetilde{r}^2}}\,.
\end{equation}

This is called the \emph{proper distance} (the subscript \(P\) is for ``proper''): the integration, at zero \(\dd{\Omega}\) and zero \(\dd{t}\), of the radial part of the metric.

On the other hand (OTOH), the flux of photons can give us the \emph{luminosity distance}, which is actually measurable.

We want to derive the Hubble law (\(v = H_0 d\)) mathematically. It can also be restated as \(cz = H_0 d\). 

\begin{greenbox}
  why?
\end{greenbox}

For a fixed source at \(d = ar\), na√Øvely we would have:
%
\begin{equation}
  \dot{d} = \dot{a} r = \frac{\dot{a} }{a} ar = H_0  d
\end{equation}

We can ``move away from the current epoch by Taylor expanding''.

The scale factor \(a(t)\) can be written as

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    a(t) &\simeq a_0 + \dot{a}_0 (t-t_0 ) + \frac[i]{1}{2} \ddot{a}(t-t_0)^2\\
    &= a_0 \qty(1 + \frac{\dot{a} }{a_0}|_{t_0 } (t-t_0 ) - \frac{1}{2} q_0 H_0 ^2 (t-t_0 ))\,,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
where \(q_0 \defeq - \ddot{a_0 } a_0 / (\dot{a_0 } )^2\) is called the \emph{deceleration parameter} by historical reasons: people thought they would see deceleration when first writing this.

(the Hubble \emph{constant} is not constant wrt \emph{time} , but wrt \emph{direction}!)

The deceleration parameter is actually measured to be negative.

Now, \(1 + z = a_0 / a\) can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    1+ z \simeq \qty(1 + \frac{\dot{a} }{a_0}|_{t_0 } (t-t_0 ) - \frac{1}{2} q_0 H_0 ^2 (t-t_0 ))^{-1}\,.
\end{equation}

Do note that this is derived by using at most second order in the distance interval: when expanding we cannot trust terms of order higher than second. Expanding with this in mind we get:
%
\begin{equation}
  1+ z \simeq
  1 - H_0 \Delta t + \frac{q_0 }{2} H_0^2 \Delta t^2 + H_0^2 \Delta t^2\,,
\end{equation}
%
therefore
%
\begin{equation}
  z = H_0 (t_0 - t) + \qty(1 + \frac{q_0}{2}) H_0^2 (t_0 - t)^2\,.
\end{equation}

Rearranging the equation we get
%
\begin{equation}
  t_0 - t = z \qty(H_0 + \qty(1+\frac{q_0}{2})H_0 z)^{-1}\,,
\end{equation}
%
but as before we must expand to get only the relevant orders:
\begin{equation}
  t_0 - t = H_0 (t_0 - t) + \qty(1+ \frac{q_0}{2}H_0^2 (t_0 - t)^2)
\end{equation}

We would like the time interval to disappear: for photons \(\dd{s^2} =0\), therefore in that case \(c^2 \dd{t^2} = a^2 (t) \dd{r^2} / (1-kr^2) \). Taking a square root and integrating:
\begin{equation}
  \int_{t}^{t_0 } \frac{c \dd{t}}{a(t)}
  = \pm \int_r^0 \frac{\dd{\widetilde{r}}}{\sqrt{1-kr^2}}\,,
\end{equation}
%
where the plus or minus sign comes from\dots

The integral on the RHS can be solved analytically: it is 

\begin{equation}
  \begin{cases}
      \arcsin r \qquad k=1 \\
      r \qquad k=0 \\
      \operatorname{arcsinh} r \qquad k = -1
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
in all cases, it is just \(r\) up to \emph{second} order (since the next term in the expansion of an arcsine or hyperbolic arcsine etc is of third order).

On the other side, we have:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{a_0 }
  \int_{t_0 }^t c\dd{\widetilde{t}} \qty(1 + H_0 (\widetilde{t} - t_0) - \frac{q_0}{2}H_0^2 (\widetilde{t} - t_0)^2)^{-1}
\end{equation}
%
therefore, neglecting \emph{third} and higher order terms, we have:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{c}{a_0 } \qty((t_0 - t) + \frac{1}{2} H_0 (t_0 - t)^2 + o(\abs{t_0 - t} ^2)) = r \,,
\end{equation}
%
since the term proportional to \(q_0 \) only gives a third order contribution.

The explicit form of the luminosity distance was
\begin{equation}
  d_L = a_0^2 \frac{r}{a} = a_0 (1+z) r\,.
\end{equation}

The term \(a_0 \) should disappear at the end of every calculation: it is a bookkeeping parameter.
Moving on:
\begin{equation}
  d_L = a_0 (1+z) \frac{c}{a_0 H_0 } \qty(z - \frac{1}{2} (1+ q_0 )z^2)\,,
\end{equation}
%
but this also contains cubic terms:
\begin{equation}
  d_L \simeq \frac{c}{H_0} \qty(z + \frac{1}{2} (1-q_0 ) z^2 + o(z^2))\,.
\end{equation}

Therefore:
\begin{equation}
  cz = H_0 \qty(d_L + \frac{1}{2} (q_0 -1 ) \frac{H_0}{c} d_L^2)\,,
\end{equation}
%
and we can notice that the relation is approximately linear and independent of acceleration for low redshift, but we can detect the acceleration at higher redshift.
Typically we need to go at around \SI{10}{\mega\parsec}.

The parameter \(q_0 \) appears to be negative now.

We can do better than that if we go from \emph{cosmography} to \emph{cosmology}, by understanding what causes the acceleration of the expansion of the universe.

Let us expand on the concept of reshift:
