The result comes about from the following code: \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from astropy.cosmology import Planck15 as cosmo
import numpy as np
import astropy.units as u
from astropy.constants import codata2018 as ac
z3 = np.sum([n**-3 for n in range(1, 1000000)])
(2 * z3 / np.pi**2 * cosmo.Tcmb0**3 * (ac.k_B / ac.hbar / ac.c)**3).cgs
\end{lstlisting}^^E^^L
