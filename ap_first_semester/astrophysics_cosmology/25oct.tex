% Do we wish to have a part on stellar astrophysics right now, before going on with cosmology? Let him know.


% QFT must be dealt with not only at zero temperature, but also at finite temperatures.
% People started doing this in the seventies.

% The time variable is then periodic, with period \(2 \pi \beta \), where \(\beta  = 1/(k_B T)\).

% \todo[inline]{Is this connected to imaginary time?}

% This is ``in-in'' instead of ``in-out'': there are no equilibrium states before or after the interaction.

% We will simplify: we assume thermal equilibrium at any time in the evolution.
% A key point in cosmologi is the \emph{absence} of time translation invariance, therefore energy is not conserved.

% This part will come from Weinberg's book.

% We use units where \(c = k_B = \hbar = 1\). The number density of a certain species is 
%
% \begin{equation}
  % n(\dots ) = \frac{g}{(2\pi )^{3}} \int  \dd[3]{q} f(\vec{q})
% \,,
% \end{equation}
%
% where \(f(\vec{q})\) is the phase space distribution of the particles, while \(g\) is the number of helicity states of that species.
% The dots will be explained later: they are about the parametrization of the phase space distribution.

% For any species, \(E = \sqrt{m^2 + \abs{q}^2} \): this applies \emph{on shell}, for the classical equations of motion: when there are quantum fluctuations it does not hold.
% The energy density is 
%
% \begin{equation}
  % \rho (\dots) = \frac{g}{(2\pi )^3} \int  \dd[3]{q} E(\vec{q}) f(\vec{q}) 
% \,,
% \end{equation}
%
% while the pressure is 
%
% \begin{equation}
  % P (\dots) = \frac{g}{(2\pi )^3} \int  \dd[3]{q} f(\vec{q}) \frac{q^2}{3E}
% \,.
% \end{equation}
% 
% Because of isotropy, in the cases we need to consider, the dependence on \(\vec{q}\) is actually a dependence on \(\abs{\vec{q}} \equiv q \).

% What is our ansatz for the phase space distribution?  
%
% \begin{equation}
  % f(q) = \frac{1}{\exp(\frac{E-\mu }{T}) \mp 1 }
% \,,
% \end{equation}
%
% where the sign is \(-\) for bosons, \(+\) for fermions.

% The chemical potential deals with the flux of particles.
% We recover the Planck distribution when \(E = q\) and \(\mu = 0\): this tells us that photons do not have any chemical potential.
% If we measured \(\mu \neq 0 \) that would be called a \emph{spectral distortion}, but is seems like that is not the case.

% The rule for the sum of the chemical potentials only holds at equilibrium.

We can relate some chemical potentials by reactions, but not all of them: our system of equations will be degenerate, with degeneracy corresponding precisely to the globally conserved quantities (electric charge, lepton number, baryon number) which follow from the symmetry group of our theory.

If there was a global electric charge, phenomenologically we'd expect global magnetic fields, but we see them only of the order of the \SI{1}{nT}, which gives an upper bound on the global charge density.

We can estimate the orders of magnitude for the various species in the universe.
The baryon number is very small when compared to the number of photons in the universe. The lepton number is harder to estimate, but it is reasonable to assume that it is quite small as well. For slightly more detailed discussion, see Weinberg \cite[before eq. 15.6.5]{weinbergGravitationCosmologyPrinciples1972}
In the end, we can say that in the early universe \(\mu / T \ll 1\), so we can assume \(\mu \approx 0\).

Therefore, the dependence of the number density, energy density and pressure would be also on \(\mu \) but we forget it, and keep only the temperature dependence: we write \(n(T)\), \(\rho (T)\) and \(P(T)\).

From the second principle of thermodynamics we know that the entropy in a certain volume \(V\) at temperature \(T\), \(S(V, T)\) is given by: 
%
\begin{equation}
  \dd{S}  = \frac{1}{T} \qty(\dd{\rho (T, V)}  + P(T) \dd{V} )
\,.
\end{equation}
%
 
Then we have 
%
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{S}{V} = \frac{1}{T} \qty(\rho (T) + P(T))
\,,
\end{equation}
%
and 
%
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{S}{T} = \frac{V}{T} \dv{\rho (T)}{T} 
\,.
\end{equation}
%

Recall the Pfaff relations: in order for the differential to be exact it needs to be closed, which means that the second partial derivatives need to commute: 
%
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{}{T}  \qty(\frac{1}{T}\qty(\rho (T) + P(T))) 
  = \pdv{}{V} \qty(\frac{V}{T} \dv{\rho (T)}{T} ) 
\,.
\end{equation}

We can proceed with the calculation, to get: 
%
\begin{equation}
  \dv{P}{T} = \frac{1}{T} \qty(\rho (T ) + P(T))
\,.
\end{equation}
%

Cosmology has not entered into the picture yet, but it can by the third Friedmann equation, which can be rewritten as 
%
\begin{equation}
  a^3 \dv{P}{t} =\dv{}{t} \qty(a^3 (P + \rho ))
\,,
\end{equation}
%
and these two, when put together, are equivalent (check!) to 
%
\begin{equation}
  \dv{}{t} \qty(\frac{a^3}{T} (\rho + P ))=0
\,,
\end{equation}
%
therefore this quantity is a constant of motion. 


(For the RW line element, the square of the determinant \(\sqrt{-g} =  a^3 \), so we get 
%
\begin{equation}
  \dv{}{t} \qty(\sqrt{-g }  \frac{\rho + P}{T}) = 0
\,,
\end{equation}
)

So the quantity which is differentiated is constant. If we plug this back into the differential expression for the entropy, we get: 
%
\begin{equation}
  \dd{S} = \dd \qty(\frac{(\rho + P) V}{T})
\,,
\end{equation}
%
therefore the differentiated quantities are equal up to a constant, but since \(V \propto a^3\) we get that the \emph{entropy is constant}.

\begin{equation}
  S \equiv S(a^3, T) 
  = \frac{a^3}{T} \qty(\rho + P)
  = \const
\,.
\end{equation}

Since \(\rho \propto T^{4}\) and \(\rho \propto a^{-4}\), we expect Tolman's law: \(Ta \sim 1\).

Also, for photons \(P  = \rho / 3\): so we get \(S \propto \frac[i]{4}{3} (a^3/T) T^{4} \propto T^3 a^3 = \const\).

We only consider photons since they have a much larger number density.

\todo[inline]{Is this because the suppression is exponential while the ratio of energies is somehow polynomial?}

Now we wish to do the integrals for the thermodynamical quantities: 
%
\begin{equation}
  \int  \dd[3]{\vec{q}} = 4 \pi \int_0^{\infty}  \dd{q} q^2 
\,,
\end{equation}
%
so we get 
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  n(T) &= \frac{g}{(2\pi^2} \int  \dd{q} q^2 f(q) \\ 
  \rho (T) &= \frac{g}{2\pi^2} \int  \dd{q} q^2 f(q) E(q) \\ 
  P (T) &= \frac{g}{6\pi^2} \int  \dd{q} q^2 f(q) \frac{q^2}{E(q)} 
\,,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
which can be solved analytically in the ultrarelativistic and nonrelativistic approximations.

Ultrarelativistic means \(q \gg m\): actually we compare these to the temperature: we define \(x = q/T\), and then the energy is \(\sqrt{x^2+ m^2/T^2} \): we suppose \( m/T \ll 1\).

The momentum will not always be large, but the cases in which it is large give a much greater contribution if the temperature is large.

\paragraph{Ultrarelativistic}

We approximate \(E(q) \sim q\), so  
%
\begin{equation}
  n(T) = \frac{g}{2 \pi^2} \int _{\mathbb{R}^{+}} \dd{q} q^2 \qty(\exp(q/T) \mp 1 )^{-1} 
\,,
\end{equation}
%
%
\begin{equation}
    \rho (T) = \frac{g}{2 \pi^2} \int _{\mathbb{R}^{+}} \dd{q} q^3 \qty(\exp(q/T) \mp 1 )^{-1} 
  \,,
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
    P (T) = \frac{g}{6 \pi^2} \int _{\mathbb{R}^{+}} \dd{q} q^3 \qty(\exp(q/T) \mp 1 )^{-1} 
\,,
\end{equation}
%
so we can see that in this approximation, which is equivalent to \(m \approx 0\), we get matter behaving like radiation: \(P = \rho /3\).  
The result of the integrals depends on the type of the particles, and it is 
%
\begin{equation}
  n(T) = \begin{cases}
      \frac{\xi (3)}{\pi^2} g T^3 & BE  \\
      \frac{3}{4}\frac{\xi (3)}{\pi^2} g T^3 & FD  
  \end{cases}
\,,
\end{equation}
%
and we get the proportionality to \(T^3\).
For the energy density:
\begin{equation}
    \rho (T) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{\pi^2}{30} g T^4 & BE  \\
        \frac{7}{8}\frac{\pi^2}{30} g T^4 & FD  
    \end{cases}
  \,,
\end{equation}
and for the pressure we just divide by 3.
For photons, \(g=2\) and they are bosons, so we get 
%
\begin{equation}
  \rho _\gamma  = \frac{\pi^2}{15} T^{4}
\,.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Nonrelativistic}

Now \(m \gg T\), so we get \(E \approx m + \frac{q^2}{2m} + O((q/\sqrt{m})^{4})\) by expanding.

So, can we just substitute this? It would seem like this makes the exponential very large, so the difference between bosons and fermions becomes negligible. So, to zeroth order in (\(q^2/m\)) we get 
%
\begin{equation}
  f \approx \exp(-\frac{m- \mu }{T}) 
\,,
\end{equation}
%
and then 
%
\begin{equation}
  n = \frac{g}{2 \pi^2} \exp(-\frac{m- \mu }{T}) \int _{\mathbb{R}^{+}} \dd{q}q^2 
\,,
\end{equation}
%
which diverges. This is the ultraviolet catastrophe: we need the \emph{Planckian}, by considering the first order in \(q^2/m\): then
%
\begin{equation}
    n = \frac{g}{2 \pi^2} \exp(-\frac{m- \mu }{T}) \int _{\mathbb{R}^{+}} \dd{q}q^2 \exp(-\frac{q^2}{2mT}) 
    = g \qty(\frac{mT}{2 \pi })^{3/2} \exp(\frac{\mu - m}{T}) 
  \,,
\end{equation}
where we applied the identity 
%
\begin{equation}
  \int _{\mathbb{R}} \dd{x} x^2 \exp(-\alpha x^2) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi } }{2 \alpha^{3/2}} 
\,.
\end{equation}
%

To recover the energy density and pressure we could do \(\rho = m n\) and \(P = n T\). 

\todo[inline]{Do these come out of doing the other two integrals?}

Therefore, \(P = T \rho / m\), so \(P \ll \rho \): for nonrelativistic particles, we can deal with them as \emph{noninteracting dust}.

\(P = nT\) is just the ideal gas law.

If we compare relativistic particles to nonrelativistic ones, the former dominate the latter in terms of all of these three quantities.
