\section{Measuring distances} 

We want to be able to compute the comoving radius, given our knowledge of the evolution of the distribution of energy density in time.

% We will neglect spatial curvature. 
We have shown that the luminosity distance is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
  d_L \equiv \sqrt{\frac{L}{4 \pi \ell}}
  = a_0 (1+z) r(z)
\,.
\end{equation}

Also recall \emph{conformal time} \(\eta\), which is defined by its relation to cosmic time, \(a(\eta ) \dd{\eta} = \dd{t}\): it allows us to write the FLRW metric as
%
\begin{equation}
  \dd{s^2} = a^2(\eta ) \qty(c^2 \dd{\eta^2} - \frac{\dd{r^2} }{1 - k r^2} - r^2 \dd{\Omega^2} )
\,.
\end{equation}

This is very important when we talk about zero-mass particles, with no intrinsic length scale: the photon, which is our primary tool for astrophysical observations, is one of these.
This can be written in terms of the variable \(\chi\): 
%
\begin{equation}
  \dd{s^2}  = a^2(\eta ) \qty(c^2 \dd{\eta^2} - \dd{\chi^2} - f^2_k (\chi ) \dd{\Omega^2})
\,,
\end{equation}
%
where \(f_k(\chi )=r\) is equal to \(\sin(\chi ) \), \(\chi \) or \(\sinh(\chi )\) if \(k\) is equal to \(1\), \(0\) or \(-1\); in other words we either have \(\chi = \arcsin(r)\), \(\chi = r\) or \(\chi = \operatorname{arcsinh}(r)\).

If we look at photons moving radially we do not need to account for the angular part, and we find
%
\begin{equation}
  \dd{s^2} = 0 = a^2(\eta ) \qty(c^2 \dd{\eta^2} - \dd{\chi^2})
\,,
\end{equation}
%
therefore \(c^2 \dd{\eta^2} = \dd{\chi^2}\):  we get \(c \qty(\eta (t_0 ) - \eta (t_e)) = \chi (r_e) - \chi (r_0 )\), where a subscript \(e\) means ``emission'', while a subscript \(0\) means detection. 
We are choosing the negative sign when simplifying the square, since the problem we are considering is that of radiation starting from an astrophysical source and coming towards us: its radial coordinate \(\chi \) decreases when the temporal coordinate \(\eta \) increases. 

This means that we can find out the comoving distance \(\Delta \chi \) between two events by calculating the difference between their comoving times \(\Delta \eta \).
This is what was meant by the fact that this expression of the metric is useful for massless particles: the scale factor gets factored out, we can write the expression in a very simple way.

\begin{equation}
  \dd{\eta} = \frac{\dd{t} }{a}  = \frac{\dd{a} }{a \dot{a} }
\,,
\end{equation}
%
and now recall \((1+z) = a_0 / a\): we differentiate this with respect to time to find
%
\begin{equation}
  \dv{z}{t} = - \frac{a_0 }{a^2} \dot{a} = - \frac{a_0 H(z)}{a}
\,,
\end{equation}
%
% \begin{equation}
%   \frac{\dd{a}}{a^2} = \frac{\dd{a} (1+z)^2}{a^2} = - \frac{\dd{z}}{ a_0 }
% \,,
% \end{equation}
% %
% which means 
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   \dd{e} = - \frac{\dd{z}}{a_0 H(z)}
%   \,.
% \end{equation}
which means 
%
\begin{align}
\dd{\eta } = \frac{ \dd{t}}{a} = - \frac{ \dd{z}}{a_0 H(z)}
\marginnote{Took the inverse of the equation, split the differentials, used the definition of \(\eta \)}
\,,
\end{align}
%
so we get our final expression: 
%
\begin{align}
\dd{ \chi  } = \frac{ \dd{z}}{a_0 H(z)} 
\,.
\end{align}

So, if we can find a way to parametrize the Hubble parameter \(H(z)\) in terms of the redshift we will be able to measure distances.
% \todo[inline]{??? probabily there is wrong stuff here}

The Hubble parameter is given by 
%
\begin{equation}
  H^2= \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{k c^2}{a^2}
\,,
\end{equation}
%
where the density comes from several components: \(\rho (t) = \rho _r (t) + \rho _m (t) + \rho _\Lambda \), where the first term is the density of radiation and scales like \(a^{-4}\), the second is the density of matter and scales like \(a^{-3}\), the third is the density of dark energy and is constant.

In terms of the redshift, they scale like \((1+z)^{4}\), \((1+z)^{3}\) (and \((1+z)^{0}\)) respectively.

We express the Hubble parameter as a multiple of its value now: \(H(z) = H_0 E(z)\), where \(E(z)\) is an adimensional function.

Recall the definition of \(\Omega (t)\): it describes the ratio of the density of a certain type of fluid to the critical density. We can look at the \(\Omega_i (t)\) for \(i\) corresponding to matter, radiation and so on: 
%
\begin{equation}
  \Omega _i (z) = \frac{8 \pi G \rho _i (z)}{3 H^2(z)}
  = \frac{8 \pi G \rho_{i}(z=0)}{3 H_0 ^2} \times  \frac{\rho _i (z) / \rho_{i}(z=0)}{E^2(z)}
  = \Omega _{i,0} \frac{(1+z)^{\alpha }}{E^2(z)}
\,,
\end{equation}

where \(\alpha \) is the exponent of the scaling of the fluid: \(\alpha = 4\) for radiation, \(\alpha = 3\) for matter, \(\alpha = 0\) for the cosmological constant \(\Lambda \), while for spatial curvature \(\alpha = 2\).

\todo[inline]{
For the \(\Omega \) corresponding to the curvature we define: \(\Omega _k = - k c^2/(a^2 H^2)\).
Again, not sure how to interpret this: what is the EOS of spatial curvature?}

We must have 
%
\begin{equation}
  1 = \Omega _r + \Omega _m + \Omega _\Lambda + \Omega _k
\,.
\end{equation}

We can write an expression for \(E^2(z)\) by taking the ratio of the densities at emission versus now:
%
\begin{equation}
  E^2(z) = \frac{H^2}{H_0^2} = 
  \Omega _{\Lambda , 0} +  \Omega_{m, 0} (1+z)^{3}
  +\Omega_{r, 0} (1+z)^4
\,,
\end{equation}
%
and to get \(E\) we just take the square root.

Now we can finally compute our integral 
%
\begin{equation}
  \chi (z) = \frac{c}{a_0 H_0 } \int_{0}^{z} \frac{\dd{z'} }{E(z')}
\,,
\end{equation}
%

therefore 
%
\begin{equation}
  r = f_k \qty(\frac{c}{a_0 H_0 } \int_0^z \frac{\dd{z'}   }{E(z')})
\,.
\end{equation}
%

This does depend on \(k\), but the differences between positive and negative curvature are only relevant starting from third order.
If the curvature is zero, we get the comoving distance:
%
\begin{align}
d_C = r a_0 = \frac{c}{H_0 } \int_{0}^{z} \frac{ \dd{z'}}{E(z')}
\,.
\end{align}

If the curvature is not zero, we can still define a useful distance: the \emph{transverse comoving distance}, 
%
\begin{align}
d_M = a_0 r = a_0 f_k \qty(\frac{c}{a_0 H_0 } \int_0^z \frac{\dd{z'}   }{E(z')})
\,;
\end{align}
%
for \(k=0\) these two coincide.

\todo[inline]{Right? I didn't write this down but it seems natural.}

% Two weeks ago we defined the luminosity distance: now we can compute it.

Now,  suppose we are looking at a certain far-away object with angular size \(\Delta \theta \) and linear size \emph{at emission} of \(\Delta x\): then the angular diameter distance is given, in the small-angle approximation,
%
\begin{equation}
d_A = \frac{ \Delta x}{\Delta \theta } = a(t_e) r
= \frac{a_0 r_z}{1+z} = \frac{d_M}{1+z}
\,.
\end{equation}

Since the luminosity distance is given by 
%
\begin{equation}
 d_L = a_0 (1+z) r = d_M (1+z)
\,
\end{equation}
%
their ratio is  
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d_L}{d_A} = (1+z)^2
\,.
\end{equation}

\todo[inline]{This part is kind of confused, I think the concepts are well explained but there is some reorganization to do.}

\todo[inline]{Add summary of cosmological distances, with explanation of their physical meaning, drawing from \cite{hoggDistanceMeasuresCosmology2000} and \cite{davisExpandingConfusionCommon2004}.}

\section{The cosmological constant}

Einstein thought that the universe had to be static.

Recall the Friedmann equations \eqref{eq:friedmann-equations}. Now, if we look at static solutions for matter (\(p=0\)): the third equation becomes the identity, the derivatives of \(a\) are zero: therefore the second equation gives us \(\rho \equiv 0\): there cannot be matter.

Now we know that the universe is neither static nor stationary.

Einstein modified his equations in order to get a static non-empty solution.

The Einstein equations read 
%
\begin{equation}
  G_{\mu \nu } = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu }
\,,
\end{equation}
%
when \(c=1\), where the Einstein tensor \(G_{\mu \nu }\) can be defined with 
%
\begin{equation}
  G_{ \mu \nu } = R_{\mu \nu } - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu }R
\,.
\end{equation}

Einstein added a term \(- \Lambda g_{\mu \nu }\) to the LHS of the Einstein equations. This is allowed since 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item it is symmetric;
    \item it has zero covariant divergence, since \(\Lambda \) is constant while \(\nabla_{\mu } g^{\mu \nu } = 0\).
\end{enumerate}

Then, we can rewrite the EE with a modified stress-energy tensor, to which we add \(\Lambda g_{\mu \nu } / 8 \pi G\). Comparing this to an ideal fluid tensor 
%
\begin{equation}
  T_{\mu \nu } = \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
  \rho & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
  0 & p & 0 & 0 \\ 
  0 & 0 & p & 0 \\ 
  0 & 0 & 0 & p
  \end{array}\right]
\,,
\end{equation}
%
we get \(\rho \rightarrow \rho + \Lambda/ 8 \pi G \) and \(p \rightarrow p + \Lambda  / 8 \pi G\).

Inserting this into the Friedmann equations we get: 
%
\begin{equation}
  \qty(\frac{\dot{a} }{a})^2= 
  \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho + \frac{\Lambda }{3}
  - \frac{k}{a^2}
\,,
\end{equation}
%

%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = - \frac{4 \pi G}{3} \rho + \Lambda 
\,,
\end{equation}
%
while in the third equation, in the contribution \(\widetilde{\rho }  + \widetilde{p} \) the two \(\Lambda \) terms cancel. Then for the first equation we get 
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho + \frac{\Lambda}{3} = \frac{k}{a^2}
\,,
\end{equation}
%
and for the second: 
%
\begin{equation}
  4 \pi G \rho = \Lambda 
\,.
\end{equation}

Then, 
%
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda \qty(\frac{1}{3}+ \frac{2}{3}) = \Lambda = \frac{k}{a^2}
\,,
\end{equation}
%
and we want a solution with \(k=1\), \(\Lambda > 0\).

A candidate for the cosmological constant term is the vacuum energy in QFT: however the estimate given there is around \num{e120} times off.

The next topic is a solution of the Friedmann equations.
We will try to do it with \(p=0\): \(\rho \propto a^{-3}\).
