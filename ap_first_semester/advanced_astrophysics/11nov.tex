Tomorrow we have the meeting at 13.30 in room C.

On the 19th the lecture is in room A (still @ Specola).

\section{Line driven winds}

Now we deal with line driven winds.
The main mechanism is line scattering.

\subsection{Spectral lines and P-Cygni profiles}

The spectrum of a star can be roughly approximated as a blackbody spectrum: Wien's law, then, tells us that the maximum of the spectral intensity occurs for a frequency which is proportional to the temperature of the star.

\begin{bluebox}
Specifically, the blackbody spectrum has the shape: 
%
\begin{align}
I_\nu \propto \frac{\nu^3}{\exp(\frac{h \nu }{k_B T}) - 1}
\,,
\end{align}
%
so its maximum can be found by differentiating: setting \(x = h \nu / k_B T\), this yields the equation \(x/3 = 1- e^{-x}\), which can be solved numerically to see that the solutions are \(x=0\) and \(x \approx\num{2.82143937}\).
We keep the positive solution: then we can see that 
%
\begin{align}
\nu _{\text{max}} \approx \num{2.82} \frac{k_B T}{h}
\,.
\end{align}

This does \emph{not} correspond to the maximum of the intensity expressed in terms of the wavelength: that formula looks like 
%
\begin{align}
I_\lambda \propto \frac{\lambda^{-5}}{\exp(\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T}) - 1}
\,,
\end{align}
%
whose maximum can be found similarly to before: if we set \(x = \lambda k_B T / hc\), the equation to solve becomes 
%
\begin{align}
-5 x \qty(e^{1/x} -1) + e^{1/x} = 0
\,,
\end{align}
%
which can be solved numerically to yield \(x \approx 1/\num{4.96511423174}\), so 
%
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\lambda _{\text{max}}} \approx 4.97 \frac{k_B T}{hc}
\,.
\end{align}
%
These are both artefacts of the fact that we are plotting probability distributions: the variable matters, since to go from one to the other we must multiply by \(\abs{\dv*{\nu }{\lambda }}\).
A figure which is more representative since it is variable-independent is the \emph{average} energy of a photon: 
%
\begin{align}
E _{\text{mean}} \approx 3.832 k_B T
\,.
\end{align}
\end{bluebox}

Many of the strongest absorption lines of abundant elements such as Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Silicon, Sulfur and Iron are in the UV, where the flux of stars is usually low. However, if the star is very hot, then the peak of the Planckian is near or in the UV band: specifically, the peak of the distribution in wavelength moves into the UV when the temperature is somewhere between \SI{7000}{K} and \SI{8000}{K}.

The spectral lines in winds are characterized by a large width: the wavelength shift is due to the Doppler effect from the outflowing motion.
\subsubsection{Spectral line formation}

\paragraph{Line scattering}
A process like: 
%
\begin{align}
\ket{0} + \gamma _{\text{in}} \rightarrow \ket{1}
\rightarrow \ket{0} + \gamma _{\text{out}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
the energies of the in and out photons are almost the same, they may be slightly different due to the Doppler shift due to thermal motion.
The direction of the photons may be different. If \(\ket{0}\) is indeed the ground state of the system, this is called \emph{resonance scattering}. 

\paragraph{Emission by recombination}
An electron collides with an ion (which is in a high-energy continuum state), and causes it to recombine into a less energetic state: 
%
\begin{align}
e^{-} + \ket{\text{cont}}_{\text{ion}} 
% \qty(\rightarrow
% \ket{n} + \gamma 
% ) 
\rightarrow
\ket{0} + \gamma 
\,,
\end{align}
%
it may pass through one or several excited state(s) on its way to the ground state.
For each deexcitation we have a spectral line photon.
We can see this as emission lines in a spectrum.
\todo[inline]{What is HEX emission?}

\paragraph{Emission from collisional or photo-excitation}
Collisional excitation is a process like:
%
\begin{align}
\ket{0} \overset{\text{collision}}{\rightarrow} \ket{2} \rightarrow \ket{1} + \gamma 
\rightarrow \ket{0} + 2 \gamma 
\,
\end{align}
%
with \(m < n\). The collisional excitation is efficient at high temperatures and densities, in plasmas: because of this process we see emission lines from hot coronas.

Photo excitation is a process like: 
%
\begin{align}
\ket{0} + \gamma \rightarrow
\ket{2} 
\rightarrow
\ket{1} + \gamma 
\rightarrow
\ket{0} + 2 \gamma 
\,:
\end{align}
%
it occurs if a photon excites the ground state into a higher state, but the descent to lower energy states occurs in more then one step: then a higher-energy photon is absorbed and two or more lower-energy ones are emitted.
In principle we could see emission lines from this process in stellar winds, but in practice the most likely thing to happen is simply resonance scattering, which does not significantly change the energy of the photon.

\paragraph{Pure absorption}
A process like 
%
\begin{align}
\ket{1} + \gamma \rightarrow \ket{2} 
\rightarrow \ket{0}  + \gamma 
\,,
\end{align}
%
which is not relevant for stellar winds since it needs an excited atom to start and there are few, the vast majority are in their ground state.

\paragraph{Masering by stimulated emission}
A process like 
%
\begin{align}
\ket{1} + \gamma 
\rightarrow \ket{0} + 2 \gamma 
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the two emitted photons are equal both in energy and direction to the incoming one. 

If there is no velocity gradient, this process can generate a strong and narrow emission line. 
A velocity gradient inhibits it because of the Doppler effect.
This process is relevant for the winds of cool stars.

\subsubsection{P-Cygni profiles}

We have components due both to absorption and emission: these make up the so-called P-Cygni profile: a spectral line characterized  by a blue-shifted absorption and a red-shifted emission with respect to the base spectrum profile.

They are mainly found for the resonance lines of C IV, N V, Si II and Mg II. 

We consider a source which emits a spherically symmetric wind, continuum radiation and the gas has an absorption line at some wavelength \(\lambda_0 \). 

This wavelength is shifted to \(\lambda = \lambda_0 (1 + v)\), where \(v\) is the velocity of the gas relative to the emission: it is positive if the gas is receding away from the emitter, and negative otherwise.

The region of the wind which is directed at us corresponds to a blue-shifted absorption, which is caused by atoms moving towards us at velocities \(0 \leq v \leq + v_\infty\): so the absorption looks something like \(- k [0 \leq v \leq v_\infty]\) (this is very rough, but can serve as a first model).

For line emission, its profile will be symmetric centered at \(v=0\) (since most of the radiation comes from the photosphere), and the spectral profile looks something like a Gaussian centered on the original wavelength.

We can gather data from these profiles: for example, the maximum Doppler shift of the absorption corresponds to the maximum velocity \(v_{ \infty }\).

We can also infer the number densities of the chemical species in the wind: 
%
\begin{align}
  n_i  = \frac{X_i \rho }{A_i m_u}
\,,
\end{align}
%
by comparing the observed profile with simulations: then we will have the density profile \(\rho (r) = \sum_i n_i m_i\), and since we also have the velocity profile \(v(r)\) we can derive the mass loss rate using the continuity equation.

\paragraph{Absorption lines}

The opacity of the spectral lines is several orders of magnitude larger than the continuum opacity: for example, the opacity of the IV line of Carbon is \(\sim \num{e6} \kappa_{es}\).

When a photon is absorbed, the momentum increases by \(\Delta p = h \nu / c = h / \lambda \). 
The increase in velocity when a typical metal (\(m \sim 20 m_H\)) absorbs a typical UV photon (wavelength \SI{e-7}{m}) is of the order \(\Delta v \approx \SI{2e-1}{m/s}\). 

Typically, due to the redistribution of momentum among atoms, the \emph{effective} change in velocity is something like four orders of magnitude less: \SI{2e-5}{m/s}, since the ions involved in this process typically contribute around \num{e-4} to the total mass of the gas (and \num{e-5} to the number: they are mostly heavy, while most of the gas is light).
This is because the light elements - Hydrogen and Helium - are either fully ionized (\ce{H+} and \ce{He++}) so they have no electrons, or have absorption lines in the far UV where the flux is low (\ce{He+}).

All the gas is then accelerated by the radiation.

In order to accelerate the gas to \SI{2e6}{m/s} we'd need \num{e11} photons.
If the distance to accelerate to terminal velocity is about three sun radii, the time to accelerate is of the order \SI{e4}{s}.
So we need around \num{e7} photons per second: the typical lifetime of the transition must be at most of the order \SI{e-7}{s}.

So only transitions with oscillator strengths \(f \gtrsim 0.01\) will contribute significantly.

\todo[inline]{Oscillation strength is defined as the ratio of the quantum to the classical transition probability.
It is not really clear how the number \num{.01} is found, but the idea is that only permitted transitions contribute, which makes sense.}

The photons contribute energy and momentum to the gas: all of what they transfer, however, does not significantly impact the luminosity of the star, which is typically decreased by a single percent.

\subsubsection{Mass loss due to one line}

Let us calculate the radiation pressure due to one line.
Suppose that we have a strong absorption line at a wavelength \(\lambda_0 \) from an abundant ion, like C IV, and further suppose that the peak of the Planckian of the star is at \(\lambda_0 \). 
For now, let us assume that the line is so strong that any photon at its wavelength is readily absorbed.
We want to compute the mass loss.

The momentum equation is 
%
\begin{align}
  v \dv[]{v}{r} = - \frac{1}{\rho } \dv[]{P}{r} - \frac{GM}{r^2} + f(r)
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we need to compute the line-driven \(f(r)\).

The emitted wavelengths which are absorbed are all the ones between \(\lambda_0\) and \(\lambda_0 (1 - v_{\infty}/c)\), which the gas sees as being at \(\lambda_0 \) at some point in its acceleration. Equivalently, we can say that all the photons at frequencies \(\nu_0 \) to \(\nu_0 (1+v_{ \infty } /c)\) are absorbed

If our velocity range goes from \(v=0\) ar \(r = R\) to \(v = v_{\infty}\) at \(r = \infty\), then the total energy absorbed per unit time by the gas is: 
%
\begin{align}
  L _{\text{line}} = \int _{\nu_0 }^{\nu_0 (1 + v_{\infty}/c)} \underbrace{F_\nu 4 \pi R^2}_{{L_{\nu}}} \dd{\nu } \approx L_{\nu_0 } \Delta \nu = L_{\nu_0 } \nu_0 v_{\infty} /c
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(F_{\nu }\) is the monochromatic flux (specific spectral intensity in \(\SI{}{\erg\per\square\centi\metre\per\second\per\hertz}\)) at the photosphere, whose radius is \(R\).
We approximate the flux to be almost constant with respect to \(\nu \): this is valid as long as \(\beta_{ \infty } = v_{ \infty }/c\) is small.

\(L_{\nu_0 }\) is the specific luminosity per unit frequency at \(\nu_0 \).

The variation of momentum due to this process is 
%
\begin{align}
  \dv[]{p _{\text{rad}}}{t} = \frac{L _{\text{line}}}{c}
  = \frac{L_{\nu_0 } \nu_0 v_{\infty}}{c^2}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and the total momentum loss in the wind per second is 
%
\begin{align}
\dv[]{p _{\text{wind}}}{t} =
\dv{}{t} \qty(M v_{ \infty }) =
\dot{M} v_{\infty} 
\,,
\end{align}
%
so if we approximate the wind's momentum to be all due to the line, we can equate these two terms: then we get 
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{L_{\nu_0 } \nu_0}{c^2} = \dot{M} 
\,.
\end{align}

Now, the Planck function has the property that \(L_{\nu_0  } \nu_0 \approx 0.62 L _{\text{tot}}\) if \(\nu_0 \) is the peak (in frequency) of the Planckian.
Then we see that the mass loss rate due to one strong line is linear in the luminosity of the star. The formula then reads: 
%
\begin{align}
0.62 L _{\text{tot}} \approx \dot{M} c^2
\,.
\end{align}
%

These are additive: if we can approximate the mass loss rate and luminosity with other means, we can find the total number of spectral lines.

\begin{bluebox}
The figure \num{.62} is a red herring: the product \(\nu L_\nu \) can increase further, its maximum is slightly higher than \(\num{.7}L\). It stays above \(\num{.5}L\) in the region from \(\num{2.36} k_B T\) to \(\num{5.98} k_B T\), which is rather wide.
\end{bluebox}
