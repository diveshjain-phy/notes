\section*{Mon Nov 25 2019}

Now, let us treat the terminal vs escape velocities for O-B stars: we seem to have a linear relation between these,  for each group of stars, where we group them by effective temperature. 

If we plot \(v_{ \infty }/ v _{\text{esc}}\) in terms of \(T _{\text{eff}}\), we get three horizontal regions. 
We cannot reproduce all the data with a single \(\alpha \) value, instead we need at least three. 

We have the maximum mass loss rate when the equation 
%
\begin{align}
  \dot{M} v_{ \infty } = \tau_{w} \frac{L}{c}   
\,
\end{align}
%
with \(\tau_{w} = 1\) is satisfied. 

We can plot both sides of this equation for \(O\)-stars\footnote{Hey now, you're an O star, get your game on, go play.} and Wolf-Rayet stars of type WNL.
\(O\)-stars' observations agree with the model, WNL observations seem not to. 

We can make a plot of initial mass vs metallicity and distinghish regions fo the final fates of stars. 
Metallicity characterizes the amount of heavier-than-Helium elements in the star. 

The definition is 
%
\begin{align}
  \text{Metallicity} = \frac{m_{\text{metals}}}{m_{\text{tot}}} = Z
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(m\) denotes the mass of element of a certain species. \(1 = X + Y + Z\) are the fractional masses of hydrogen, helium and metals respectively, so \(X = m _{\text{H}}/ m _{\text{tot}}\) and so on. 

\section{Dust driven winds}

Now, we will speak of dust driven winds: we move to the cool and luminous part of the H-R diagram, which is populated by red giants and so on. 

Qualitatively, the driving mechanism is the radiation pressure on dust grains; dust can exist in low temperature regions of the atmosphere, with \(T \sim \SI{e3}{K}\). 
Dust absorbs momentum and is accelerated outwards: it is very opaque. 

The bulk of the outward travelling matter is gas: the dust is a small part, but it is dynamically coupled to the gas (it ``drags it along'', they share momentum). 

A good approximation is a wind with a force \(f \sim r^{-2}\). 
This mechanism critically depends on the dust formation radius: the distance at which the temperature becomes low enough for dust to form. 

Dust grains can absorb photons in the continuum, they are then said to be ``continuum driven'' as opposed to ``line driven''. 
Then, this very much diminishes the role of Doppler shift in making it possible for the radiation to pass through much of the gas uninterrupted. 

The typical photons in this process are infrared, on the order of \(\lambda \sim \SI{1}{\micro\metre}\). 

The dust causes significant reddening. We have low \(v _{ \infty }\) and high \(\dot{M}\).

Most of the momentum is then transferred in the subsonic region for the high \(\dot{M}\), while little energy must be transferred in the supersonic region in order for the exit velocity to be low. 

The formation of dust grains must be described with molecular chemistry, and it heavily depends on the ratios of chemical species. 

An example: the Helix Nebula. 

We define the Eddington factor: the ratio of radiative acceleration to gravity. 
In the case of radiation forces on dust, it is 
%
\begin{align}
  \Gamma_{d} = \frac{\kappa _{\text{rp}}L_{*}}{4 \pi c G M_{*}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the \(\kappa _{\text{rp}} \) is called the ``radiation pressure mean opacity'': it measures the capacity of the dust to absorb photons. 

Sometimes, we can have \(\Gamma_{d}\) greater than unity.

To a good approximation, the transsonic transition corresponds to the point at which \(\Gamma_{d}\) becomes greater than one. 

The plot of \(\Gamma_{d}\) looks something like \(\Gamma_{d} (r) = \Theta (r - r _{\text{sonic}}) \times 1.4\), where \(r _{\text{sonic}} \sim (3 \divisionsymbol 4) r_{*}\), where \(\Theta \) is the Heaviside theta.

What are the conditions in order to have a dust driven wind? We first need to  form the dust grains: they need to survive against sublimation. 
Then, the dust must be coupled enough to the gas in order to drive it. 

There are two interesting temperatures. The first is the radiative equilibrium temperature \(T _{\text{rad}}\), which is the temperature of the grains: it depends on the radiative heating and cooling of the grains. 

The second one is the condensations temperature \(T _{\text{cond}}\), below it the grain becomes a solid. 
Above \(T _{\text{cond}}\) we have sublimation. 

\(T _{\text{cond}} \sim \const\) is not a bad approximation; the radiative equilibrium temperature instead decreases. 
There is a radius at which they are equal, and for larger radii we have \(T _{\text{rad}} < T _{\text{cond}}\). 
This critical radius is called the dust condensation radius \(r_{d}\). 

Let us suppose that we are at \(r > r_d\). 
The grain then can form, and it can then gain momentum and energy from the Sun's photons, and transfer it to the gas molecules. 

We can get a lower limit to the mass loss rate because of the gas-dust coupling condition. Deriving this is complicated, but qualitatively it is since if there is less mass loss rate there is also less gas density, so there is less transfer. 

Also, we can have an upper limit on the speed of the dust driven wind. We have the maximal drift speed of a grain through the gas: the drift speed \(u_{\text{grain}} - v _{\text{gas}} \propto \rho _{\text{gas}}^{-1/2}\), so there is a radius beyond which the collisions exceed the limiting energy at which they are able to destroy the grains, so there is no further increase in the wind speed, since the dust and gas get progressively more decoupled as the density decreases. 

The properties of the grains are very important, but studying the processes in grain formation and growth is hard. 

There are both processes of accretion of the gas onto the dust particle and erosion by sputtering, collisions of the gas onto the grain. 

There will be a distribution of grain sizes, typically from \(\num{.05} \divisionsymbol \SI{.1}{\micro\metre}\): we can sometimes make the small grain approximation. 

The composition of the grains depends on the materials in the gas, particularly on the \ce{C/O} ratio (defined as a ratio of number of atoms).

If \(\ce{C/O} <1\) typically we form silicate grains, while if it is larger than one we typically form carbonaceous grains.
