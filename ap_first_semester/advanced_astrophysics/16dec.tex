\subsubsection{The main uncartainties in SN theory}

There are still many uncertain areas, both in the presupernova phase and about the explosion.

\paragraph{Presupernova phase}

The mass loss of stars in their Red and Blue Supergiant phases is unclear.

Convection is not well understood, especially when it is heavily coupled to nuclear burning. 

The cross section of the reaction \(\ce{^{12}C} (\alpha , \gamma ) \ce{^{16}O}\)\footnote{This is a shorthand notation used in nuclear physics: \(a(b,c)d\) means \(a + b \rightarrow c+d\).} is unclear.

The effects of rotation are not well understood: it can cause convective overshooting, which means that bits of a convective layer have enough momentum to be ``shot into'' another layer.

\paragraph{Explosion}

In a binary system things are more complicated. 

We do not have a self-consistent hydrodinamical model which includes neutrino transport.

% It seems that stars more massive than \(35 M_{\odot}\) have large fallback: they do not contribute to the heavy element population.

\subsubsection{Impact of the chemistry of a WR star on the fallback}

The models from Langer in 1989 differ from those of Nugis and Lamers (NL00): Langer predicts a higher mass loss rate, which as was discussed in the treatment of WR stars entails a higher \ce{^{12}C} fraction and a lower overall mass of the CO core.

So, the core is less compact and has a lower binding energy in the models by Langer: the binding energy of the core does \emph{not} increase monotonically with the ZAMS mass of the star, it has a peak of around \(B \sim \SI{6}{foe}\) around \(M _{\text{ZAMS}} \sim 30M_{\odot}\) and then slightly decreases, while in the NL00 models \(B\) increases steadily up to \SI{20}{foe} and more as \(M _{\text{ZAMS}}\) increases.

So, the nuclei in the models by Langer are less compact, therefore we predict less efficient fallback and formation of Neutron Stars as opposed to Black Holes.

These high-ZAMS-mass supernovae match well the observed type Ib/c supernovae.

As it turns out, both the models by Langer (LA89) and by Nugis-Lamers (NL00) are useful: LA89 describes stars with heavy mass loss in the pre-SN stages, while NL00 describe stars with less mass loss in the pre-SN stages, which are more likely to collapse into BHs for high initial mass.

LA89-type massive \(M > 40 M_{\odot}\) stars generally have higher yields of heavy elements than NL00-type stars.

% We can plot the mass of the various mass components of the star with respect to \(\log \qty(t _{\text{collapse}} - t)\). 

% We can also plot the mass fractions of \ce{^{12}C} and \ce{^{16}O} with respect to the fraction of \(X(\ce{^{4}He})\), which decreases with time.

% At some point the helium burning phase stops, and then we are left with a carbon/oxygen fraction which can be either higher or lower than one. 

% Depending on whether we are using a LA89 or an LN00 model we can have different behaviours. 

% The final kinetic energy after the fallback is a ``foe'': \SI{e51}{\erg}. 

% If we have a higher mass-loss rate then we will have a lower mass of the CO core, which will then be less compact. The fallback will be less efficient.

% The state of the art is that at higher initial masses BHs are more favoured. 
% It seems that BHs are more often produced by WR stars.

% According to a certain model, BHs are mainly produced by \emph{failed} supernovae: there is a discontinuity around \(M \sim 35 M_{\odot}\), above which we get a collapse and a failed supernova. 

As the metallicity increases, the mass range resulting in failed supernovae (so, the resulting BHs) decreases. 

\section{Very massive stars}

\subsection{Generalities}

Now, we discuss the evolution and final fate of very massive stars. 
They have masses in the range \(100 M_{\odot} < M _{\text{in}} < \num{5e4}M_{\odot}\). 
For these, we do not have a core collapse, but a thermonuclear explosion instead. 

There is some evidence for the existence of these stars, for example in the cluster R136: the star R136a1 has an estimated mass of \(315M_{\odot}\), the highest known of any star. 

The cluster R136 seems to be very young, with an age (\(\lesssim \SI{2}{Myr}\)). 

\paragraph{Astrophysical relevance of PCSNe}

In 2007 a Super Luminous supernova (SLSN) was observed: SLSNe can have luminosities brighter by a factor of 10 than the regular supernovae, reaching an absolute magnitude of more than \SI{-21}{mag} (the Sun's is \SI{4}{mag}!). 

Spectral analyses show that in the explosions of these stars we have a hefty production of Nickel.
Beyond the increased luminosity, the light curve of these SLSNe also decreases slower than that of regular Core Collapse Supernovae --- CCSNe.

We will need to understand under which metallicity regime we can have these SLSNe: there seems to be a metallicity threshold, since PCSNe evolve from very massive stars, as long as they avoid heavy mass loss. 
We have \(\dot{M} \propto Z\), so if the metallicity is too high the star loses too much mass to produce a PCSN. The threshold is denoted as \(Z _{\text{PCSN}}\).
It seems like the threshold is around \(Z _{\text{PCSN}}\sim \num{.006}\).

These are ``pair creation supernovae'' because the radiation they emit is more energetic than \SI{1}{MeV}? 

These might be the first contributors to the presence of metal in the universe, the Black Sabbath of the cosmos. 

Pair Creation SNe and Pair Instability SNe are the same thing. 

The relevant phase in stellar evolution is when a large amount of thermal energy goes into pair production instead of producing pressure. 

An important parameter is the mass of the helium core. 

We'd expect more and more massive stars to lose more and more mass loss through winds. 
We need a Helium core with mass such that \(40 M_{\odot} < M _{\text{He}} < 133 M_{\odot}\). If \(M _{\text{He}} < 65 M_{\odot}\) then we have ``Pulsation pair instability supernovae'', above this we have ``Pair creation supernovae''. 

The pair creation triggers the collapse. Then we have a runaway thermonuclear reaction. If this exceeds the binding energy of the star, then we have complete disintegration. 

% The threshold for this turns out to be give by around \(65 M_{\odot}\). 

The pair production makes \(\gamma _{\text{ad}} < 4/3\): this causes a gravitational collapse. 

For \(M _{\text{He}} > 133 M_{\odot}\) the infall produces a BH.

This occurs before oxygen burning. 

We have the relation \(\SI{1}{MeV} \sim \SI{e10}{K}\). 

The star is able to eject most of the material in a series of pulses even if the nuclear energy is smaller than the binding energy. 

The pulses are separated by time intervals on the order of \SI{e5}{s} to \SI{e9}{s}.
