We have the spin vector \(s^{\mu }\): it is orthogonal to the 4-velocity and 
%
\begin{align}
  \dv{}{\tau } s^{\mu } = 0
\,.
\end{align}

By symmetry we also have \(s^{\theta } =0\). 

By orthogonality to the 4-velocity in the Schwarzschild frame we have 
%
\begin{align}
  s^{t} = \frac{R^2 \Omega }{1 - \frac{2GM}{r}} s^{\varphi }
\,,
\end{align}
%
and for geodesic circular orbit we have \(\Omega^2 R^3 = GM \). 

Let us also evolve \(s^{\varphi }\): 
%
\begin{align}
  \dv{s^{\varphi }}{\tau } + \Gamma^{\varphi }_{\beta \gamma } u^{\beta  } s^{\gamma } = 0
\,,
\end{align}
%
and the nonzero Christoffel symbols which can appear are the \(\Gamma^{3}_{\beta \gamma }\) with \(\beta = 0, 3\) and \(\gamma = 0, 1, 3\). 
The only one which is nonzero is \(\Gamma^{3}_{13}\): 
%
\begin{align}
  \Gamma^{3}_{13} = \frac{1}{2} g^{33} \qty(g_{33, 1})
 = \frac{r^{-2}}{2} \qty(2r) = \frac{1}{r} 
\,.
\end{align}

Then the evolution equation is 
%
\begin{align}
  \dv{s^{\varphi }}{\tau } + \frac{1}{r} \underbrace{u^{t} \Omega}_{ u^{\varphi }} s^{r} = 0  
\,,
\end{align}
%
and as before we can use the fact that \(u^{t} = \dv*{t}{\tau }\) in order to write the equation as 
%
\begin{align}
  \dv{s^{\varphi }}{t} + \frac{\Omega}{r} s^{r} =0 
\,,
\end{align}
%
which is coupled with the equation from before: 
%
\begin{align}
    \dv{s^{r}}{t} + \qty(3GM - r)\Omega s^{\varphi }= 0
\,,
\end{align}
%
which seems to look like a harmonic oscillator: we just need to differentiate one of them, to get 
%
\begin{align}
  \dv[2]{s^{r}}{t} + (3GM-r) \Omega \dv{s^{\varphi }}{t} = \dv[2]{s^{r}}{t} - \frac{3GM-r}{r} \Omega^2 s^{r} = 0
\,,
\end{align}
%
so we found a harmonic oscillator with angular velocity 
%
\begin{align}
  \overline{\Omega} = \Omega \sqrt{1 - \frac{3GM}{r}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and since \(s^{\varphi }\) satisfies the same equation up to a constant it is also a harmonic oscillator with thee same frequency. 

We can relate them by the equation 
%
\begin{align}
  - A  \overline{\Omega} \sin(\Omega t) = R \Omega \qty(1 - \frac{3GM}{r}) s^{\varphi }
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(A\) is the constant multiplying the solution for \(s^{r}\), so in the end we have 
%
\begin{align}
  s^{\varphi } = - \frac{A}{r} \frac{\Omega}{\overline{\Omega}} \sin(\overline{\Omega} t)
\,.
\end{align}

Also, we can use 
%
\begin{align}
  s^{t} = r^2 \Omega \qty(1 - \frac{2GM}{r})^{-1} s^{\varphi }
\,.
\end{align}

By the normalization \(s^{\mu } s^{\nu } g_{\mu \nu } = 1\) we have \((s^{1})^2 g_{11} = A^2 \qty(1 - 3GM/r)^{-1}=s_{*}^2 = \const\) at \(t=0\): so 
%
\begin{align}
  A = s_{*} \sqrt{1 - \frac{3GM}{r}}
\,.
\end{align}

What does an observer see? What does somebody at infinity see? 

We call \(\Delta \varphi \) the angle between the spin vector and the radial direction: then 
%
\begin{align}
  \cos \Delta \varphi  = \frac{\text{radial component of the spin vector now}}{\text{radial component of the spin vector at }  t=0}
\,,
\end{align}
%
which means 
%
\begin{align}
  \cos(\Delta \varphi ) = \frac{e_{r} \cdot s (t)}{e_r \cdot s(0)}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(s\) is the spin vector and \(e_r\) is the radial unit vector: in Schwarzschild coordinates \(e_{r} = (0, 1/\sqrt{g_{11} } , 0, 0)\). 

This just simplifies to 
%
\begin{align}
  \cos(\Delta \varphi ) = \frac{s^{r}}{A} = \cos(\overline{\Omega}t)
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we are allowed to do this calculation in the Schwarzschild frame since the spatial velocity is always orthogonal to the radial unit vector. 
If we were to use a direction different from the radial one we'd need to boost along it.   

What does this solution mean? In the end our solution is 
%
\begin{align}
  s^{t} &= s_{*} \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{r}} \cos(\overline{\Omega} t)  \\
s^{\varphi } &= - s_{* } \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{r}} \frac{\Omega}{\overline{\Omega} r} \sin(\overline{\Omega} t)  \\
 s^{t} &= r^{2} \Omega \qty(1 - \frac{2GM}{r})^{-1} s^{\varphi }
\,,
\end{align}
%
and the solution to \(\cos(\Delta \varphi ) = \cos(\overline{\Omega} t)\) is \(\Delta \varphi = \pm \overline{\Omega} t\), and we choose the solution for continuity with the case \(M=0\). 

If we are rotating around a BH counterclockwise (with \(M \rightarrow 0\)) then the spin must rotate clockwise in order to remain aligned with itself: therefore the right solution to choose is \(\Delta \varphi = - \overline{\Omega} t\). 

This is the reason why there is a minus sign in the expression for \(s^{\varphi } \). 

The basis is rotating, and the spin must rotate the other way to compensate and remain stationary. 

Someone at infinity sees the spin to be rotating with angular velocity \(\Omega - \overline{\Omega}\), where \(\Omega \) is the \(\dv*{\varphi }{t}\) of the orbit and \(\overline{\Omega}\) is the angular velocity of the spin in the coordinate system \(\varphi , r\). 

Over a turn, which takes a time \(t = 2 \pi / \Omega \), the total \(\Delta \varphi \) is given by 
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{2\pi}{\Omega } \qty( \Omega - \overline{\Omega})
  = 2 \pi \qty(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{3GM}{r}})
  \approx \frac{3GM\pi}{r} 
\,
\end{align}
%
in the same direction as the orbit. 

Let us look at the gyroscope in a slowly rotating geometry: we consider the metric 
%
\begin{align}
  \dd{s^2} = \dd{s^2}_{\text{schw}} - \frac{4 GJ}{r} \sin^2 \theta \dd{t} \dd{\varphi } + O(J^2)
\,,
\end{align}
%
which (see homework sheet 8) is a vacuum solution to the Einstein equations. We have a 4 since we have to account both for \(g_{03} \) and \(g_{30} \). 

Reinserting  \(c\), we get: 
%
\begin{align}
  \dd{s^2} = \dd{s^2}_{\text{schw}} - \frac{4GJ}{c^3r^2} \sin^2\theta \qty(r \dd{\varphi }) \qty(c \dd{t})
\,,
\end{align}
%
then the quantity \(4GJ / c^2 r^2\) must be adimensional: then the dimensions of \(J\) are those of \(c^3 r^2 / G\), which are 
%
\begin{align}
  \SI{}{m^3 s^{-3}} \times \SI{}{m^2} \times \frac{1}{\SI{}{kg m^3 s^{-1}}} = \SI{}{kg m^2 s^{-2}} 
\,,
\end{align}
%
the dimensions of an angular momentum. 

Essentially we are doing a boost along the \(\varphi \) direction. 

Let us consider geodetic motion of the gyroscope along the rotation axis: the gyroscope is falling into the rotating BH along that axis. 

The spin starts along the \(x\) axis, and we expect a change of the spin of the order 
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{GJ}{c^3r^2}
\,.
\end{align}

We might also have terms of order 
%
\begin{align}
  O \qty(\frac{GJ}{c^3r^2} \times \frac{GM}{rc^2 })
\,,
\end{align}
%
but there cannot be terms of just order \(O(GM/rc^2)\) since if there is no spin, even with positive BH mass the spin does not change. 

The BH-mass contribution is small: then the mixed term is ``second order'', we can discard it and consider the \(M=0\) case. 

Therefore we can simply use the metric 
%
\begin{align}
  \dd{s^2} = \eta_{\mu \nu } \dd{x^{\mu }} \dd{x^{\nu }}
  - \frac{4GJ}{r} \sin^2 \theta \dd{t} \dd{\varphi }
\,,
\end{align}
%
and only keep the \(O(J)\) terms.
