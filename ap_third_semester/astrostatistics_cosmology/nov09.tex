We have a parameter vector \(\vec{x}\), and in a step in our MCMC we want to move to a new parameter \(\vec{y}\). 
We start off with a transition proposal distributed according to the distribution \(Q\), which can depend on \(\vec{x}\).
This \(Q\) may, for example, be a simple Gaussian. 

Then, we have an acceptance/rejection step: we accept the step with a probability 
%
\begin{align}
\alpha (y | x) = \min \qty(\frac{p(\vec{y}) Q(\vec{x} | \vec{y})}{p(\vec{x}) Q(\vec{y} | \vec{x})}, 1)
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(p\) is the posterior.
If we are using a Gaussian \(Q\), it is symmetric, therefore we only have \(\alpha = \min (p(\vec{y}) / p (\vec{x}), 1)\). 
If the posterior is higher in \(\vec{y}\) than in \(\vec{x}\) we always accept the step, else we accept it sometimes. 

We need to check whether the MC is ergodic: the transition probability reads 
%
\begin{align}
T(y | x) &= \alpha Q = 
\min \qty(\frac{p(\vec{y}) Q(\vec{x} | \vec{y})}{p(\vec{x}) Q(\vec{y} | \vec{x})}, 1)
Q(\vec{y} | \vec{x})  \\
&= \frac{1}{p(\vec{x}) Q(\vec{y} |\vec{x})} \min \qty[p(\vec{y} ) Q(\vec{x} | \vec{y}), p(\vec{x}) Q(\vec{y} | \vec{x})]
Q(\vec{y} | \vec{x})  \\
&= \frac{1}{p(\vec{x})} \min \qty[p(\vec{y} ) Q(\vec{x} | \vec{y}), p(\vec{x}) Q(\vec{y} | \vec{x})]
\,,
\end{align}
%
therefore we have 
%
\begin{align}
T(\vec{y} | \vec{x}) p(\vec{x}) = \min \qty[p(\vec{y} ) Q(\vec{x} | \vec{y}), p(\vec{x}) Q(\vec{y} | \vec{x})]
= T(\vec{x} | \vec{y}) p(\vec{y})
\,,
\end{align}
%
which is precisely the \textbf{detailed balance} condition, with the stationary distribution being precisely \(p\), the posterior. 

Since we only need to compute ratios of the posterior, we never need to compute the evidence. 

\subsection{Gibbs sampling}

We start from a parameter vector \(\vec{x}\), and we only update the \(i\)-th parameter, keeping the others fixed, according to the conditional probability for that parameter given all the others: \(\mathbb{P}(\theta _i | \theta_1 , \hat{\theta}_i, \theta _n)\). 
Here we always accept the step. 

We update each parameter separately (using the old values), and then move the full parameter vector together. 
It is a special case of Metropolis-Hastings with \(Q\) being the conditional probability and acceptance probability equal to 1. 
We might want to use it if we have easy access to the conditional distribution. 

The issue is always convergence: we have convergence theorems for \(N \to \infty \), but we need \emph{fast} convergence practically. 

We can compute averages and standard deviations as 
%
\begin{align}
\expval{\theta _i} &\approx \frac{1}{N} \sum _{k=1}^{N} \theta^{(k)}_i  \\
\sigma^2_{\theta _i} &\approx \frac{1}{N} \sum _{k=1}^{N} \abs{\theta^{(k)}_i}^2 - \expval{\theta _i}^2
\,.
\end{align}

This is not done over \emph{all} the points, but only over the ones calculated after convergence. 

Marginalization is done as such: 
%
\begin{align}
p(\theta_2) = \int \dd{\theta _1} p(\theta_1 , \theta _2 ) 
= \int \dd{\theta _1} p(\theta_1 | \theta _2) p(\theta_1 )
\,.
\end{align}

We can simply build a marginal histogram by neglecting a coordinate and then binning. 

\subsection{Convergence}

How do we verify convergence? This is the complicated part.
We can do a trace plot: 
%
\begin{align}
\Tr[ - \log \mathcal{P}] = - \sum _{k=1}^{M} \frac{1}{k} \log \mathcal{P}(\theta^{(k)}_i | \vec{d})
\,,
\end{align}
%
which should converge to a fixed maximum value after some time. 
However, we might not have covered a representative region of the full posterior. 

A standard technique is to start \(M\) different chains, and for each compute the average separately. 

We can compute the average of each chain, \(\overline{\theta}^{J}\) (where \(J = 1 \dots M\)); and the total average \(\overline{\theta}\) over all the chains. 
We can also estimate the variance of each chain, \(w^{J}\): 
%
\begin{align}
w^{J} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \qty(\theta^{J}_{i} - \overline{\theta}^{J})^2
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the \(n-1\) is the Bessel correction, needed because we use the estimated average instead of the true average. 

Through manipulation, we can show that 
%
\begin{align}
w^{J} &= \frac{n}{n-1} s_J - \frac{n}{n-1} \var{\overline{\theta}^{J}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\var{\overline{\theta}^J} = (\overline{\theta}^{J} - \mu )^2\) is an estimator for the variance of the \emph{mean} of the parameter vector, while \(s_J\) is the estimator of the true variance of the chain. 
Flipping the expression we can find 
%
\begin{align}
s_J = \frac{n-1}{n} w^{J} + \var{\overline{\theta}^{J}}
\,.
\end{align}

We can estimate the variance of the chain mean as 
%
\begin{align}
\widehat{\var{\overline{\theta}}} = \frac{1}{M-1} \sum _{J=1}^{M} (\overline{\theta}^{J}- \overline{\theta})^2 = \frac{B}{n}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and then we can average the single chain variance estimators: 
%
\begin{align}
W = \frac{1}{M} \sum _{J=1}^{M} w^{J}
\,,
\end{align}
%
so then we get the estimator 
%
\begin{align}
\hat{V} = \frac{n-1}{n} W + \frac{B}{n}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and then we can define \(\hat{R} = \hat{V} / W\): we expect \(B/n\) to become irrelevant asymptotically. 
If \(\hat{R}\) is of order 1 then we can say that we have converged. 
Typically, we say that when \(\hat{R} \lesssim \num{1.02}\) we have converged. 

\todo[inline]{Add more calculations}

These tests are not fool-proof: we try to falsify the hypothesis of convergence, and at a certain point we stop trying to do so.
