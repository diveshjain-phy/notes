\textbf{Homework} for the month of November: exercise 4, exercise 5, NOT exercise 6 nor 7, exercise 8, exercise 9.

We can compute the average value of some function \(g\) of our parameters \(\vec{\theta}\), defined as 
%
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E} (g(\vec{\theta})) = \int g(\vec{\theta}) p(\vec{\theta}) \dd{\vec{\theta}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
as 
%
\begin{align}
\hat{E} (g(\vec{\theta})) = \frac{1}{N} \sum _{i=1}^{N} g(\vec{\theta}_i)
\,,
\end{align}
%
which converges as \(N \to \infty \) to the true value, as long as the \(\vec{\theta}_i\) are iid sampled according to their distribution \(p(\vec{\theta})\).
This converges to the true value with a variance \(\var{\hat{E}} = \sigma^2 / N\). 

However, it is difficult to sample points from a generic multidimensional distribution. 
This is the problem we will treat now. 

A possible solution is rejection sampling. See the numerical methods course for a detailed explanation of the method. 

In short, in order to sample from a distribution \(f(x)\) we choose a distribution \(g(x)\) which \emph{embeds} the generic one we have: this means that \(g(x) \geq M f(x)\) for some real number \(M\). 
We generate numbers \(x\) according to \(g(x)\), and then we reject the number we generated a fraction \(M f(x) / g(x)\) of the time (this can be done through a uniform distribution).
This procedure yields samples distributed according to \(f(x)\).

This can be wasteful, especially in high dimensions, due to the \textbf{curse of dimensionality}. 
Consider the volume of a \(D\)-dimensional sphere and a \(D\)-dimensional cube with a side equal to the diameter of the sphere. 
The ratio is \(\pi /4\) in two dimensions, \(\pi /6\) in three dimensions, and it approaches zero for \(D \to \infty \).

So, rejection sampling fails in practice. 
The alternative approach is Markov Chain Monte Carlo. 
The idea here is to generate sequences of correlated variables: a random walk, with some specific rule giving us the next step. 
Starting from \(\vec{\theta}_{(1)}\) we move to a point \(\vec{\theta}_{(2)}\); each point is calculated with a rule which depends only on the previous one.
The chain has very short-term memory. 

It is possible to choose a rule so that after a long run of this chain the distribution of the points reached will be the same as that of the distribution. 

How do we walk in parameter space?
We start by discussing MCMC in general, as a mathematical tool.

A Markov Chain is a sequence of random variables; 
we start with a state space \(\Omega \), which we will assume to be discrete (since in any practical application we will not have infinite precision).

A sequence of random variables \(X\) parametrized by \(t\), such that \(X_t \in \Omega \) is a MC iff\footnote{If and only if.} the probability that the variable takes on a certain value at a certain moment is independent of all but the previous step:
%
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(X_t = s_t | X_{t-1} = s_{t-1})
= \mathbb{P}(X_t = s_t |X_{t-1} = s_{t-1}, \qty{ X_{t_i} = s_{t_i}}_i)
\,,
\end{align}
%
for any set of times satisfying \(t_i \leq t-2\). 

To characterize a MC we need to provide all the probabilities which can be written like 
%
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(X_{t+1} = s_{t+1} | X_t = s_t)
\,.
\end{align}

These will need to be \(\abs{\Omega }^2\) numbers, and are called \emph{transition probabilities} in a \textbf{transition matrix}. 

The transition matrix can be written as 
%
\begin{align}
T_{ij} = \mathbb{P}(X_{t+1} = s_i | X_{t} = s_j)
\,.
\end{align}

In order for the probabilities to be normalized we need to impose \(\sum_j T_{ij} = 1\) for any \(i\).
So, the degrees of freedom are actually \(\abs{ \Omega } \qty(\abs{\Omega }-1)\).

In a general MC these probabilities can change at each step; a \emph{stationary} (or homogeneous) MC is one in which \(T_{ij}\) is constant. 

An \textbf{ergodic} MC is one if any state can be reached from any other state (not necessarily in a single step).
