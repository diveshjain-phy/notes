We come back to our noisy dataset \(x_i = \mu + n_i\). 
If our noise comes from a Gaussian with a \emph{known}, \emph{constant} \(\sigma \), then we have 
%
\begin{align}
\mathscr{L}(x_i | \mu , \sigma )
= \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi }} 
\exp(- \frac{1}{2} \frac{(x_i - \mu )^2}{\sigma^2})
\,.
\end{align}

We also assume that the realizations of the noise are independent. 
So, the combined likelihood for all the data is given by 
%
\begin{align}
\mathscr{L}(\vec{x} | \mu , \sigma ) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} \mathscr{L}(x_i, \mu , \sigma )
\,.
\end{align}

Now, choosing a prior as we mentioned is difficult in general. Until now we have assumed that our noninformative prior would be constant. 
For the type of parameter we have now --- \(\mu \) is a \emph{location} parameter --- works; however we have an issue: a uniform distribution must have a certain range in which it is nonzero, elsewhere it is zero. 
This range must be finite.
 
Zero cannot be updated: this is a problem.
We can, however take a prior that is so wide that it is nonzero in any place the likelihood is measurably nonzero. Practically speaking we only work up to finite precision, so this is not a problem. 

We only case about proportionality: the posterior is proportional to the likelihood, so
%
\begin{align}
P \propto \prod_{i=1}^{N} \exp(- \frac{1}{2} \frac{(x_i - \mu )^2}{\sigma^2})
\,,
\end{align}
%
therefore the log-posterior is 
%
\begin{align}
L = \log P = - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \sum _{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu ) + \const
\,,
\end{align}
%
so if we want to find the maximum (log)-posterior: 
%
\begin{align}
\dv{L}{\mu }  = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{x_i- \mu }{\sigma^2}  =0 
\,,
\end{align}
%
meaning that 
%
\begin{align}
N \mu = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i \implies \hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i
\,.
\end{align}

We can also compute the estimate of the error on the estimate: 
%
\begin{align}
\dv[2]{L}{\mu } =- \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\sigma^2} = - \frac{N}{\sigma^2}
\,,
\end{align}
%
therefore 
%
\begin{align}
\sigma_\mu = \qty(- \dv[2]{L}{\mu })^{-1/2} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}
\,.
\end{align}

The great simplification we made here was that we are dealing with only one parameter.
In any realistic astrophysics scenario we have at least a dozen. 

\section{Multiparameter estimation}

\subsection{A two-parameter example}

We consider a photon counting experiment. 
We have a diffraction experiment: we can measure light in \(M\) frequency channels, labelled by \(k\), and at different angles. 

Our model (we need one for parameter estimation) is that for each frequency channel \(k\) we expect a Gaussian spatial profile centered around \(x_0 \) --- for simplicity we assume \(x_0 \) is known, and that the standard deviation \(w\) is known as well.
We are interested in the amplitude \(A\) of this Gaussian peak.

Also, we will have spatially constant noise with amplitude \(B\).
We need to estimate \(A\) and \(B\) jointly; \(B\) is a \emph{nuisance parameter} we would ideally integrate over later. 

We expect that the measured data at a frequency channel will look like 
%
\begin{align}
D_k = n_0 \qty[ A\exp(- \frac{(x_k - x_0)^2}{2 w^2} + B)]
\,.
\end{align}

The parameter \(n_0 \) accounts for the fact that if we measure for longer we see more photons. 

Photons, both noise and signal, are expected to obey Poissonian statistics: 
%
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(N_k | D_k) = \frac{D_k^{N_k} e^{- D_k}}{N_k!}
\,,
\end{align}
%
which is the likelihood: the probability of the data, given our model. 
Our actual likelihood will be given by \(\mathscr{L} = \prod_k \mathbb{P}(N_k | D_k)\).

What is our prior \(\mathbb{P}(A,B | I)\)? We know that these parameters cannot be negative, so we just take a uniform bivariate prior on \(A\geq 0\),  \(B \geq 0\).
As before, this is just meant to say ``uniform over all representable values''. 

We will discuss later that by the nature of \(A\) as a scale parameter it would be more reasonable to take \(\log A\) to be uniform.

The posterior will then be 
%
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(A, B | N_k, I) \propto
 \prod_k \frac{D_k^{N_k} e^{-D_k}}{N_k!}
\,.
\end{align}

This then depends on two parameters, and we can maximize it numerically. It is a difficult problem computationally, but not conceptually. 

How can we model this in order to give an error? We can approximate it as a bivariate Gaussian. 

In general, a multivariate Gaussian is given as 
%
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{(2 \pi )^{n/2} \abs{\Sigma }^{1/2}}
\exp(- \frac{1}{2} (\vec{x} - \vec{\mu})^{\top} \Sigma^{-1} (\vec{x} - \vec{\mu}))
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\Sigma \) is the \textbf{covariance matrix} of the two variables. 
On the diagonal we have the variance of each variable: \(\Sigma_{ii} = \sigma_i^2\), so \((\Sigma^{-1})_{ii} = 1 / \sigma _i^2\) as long as the covariance (meaning, the nondiagonal elements) is zero.
