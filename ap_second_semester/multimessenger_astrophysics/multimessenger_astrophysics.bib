  abstract = {We report a measurement of the proton-air cross-section for particle production at the center-of-mass energy per nucleon of 57 TeV. This is derived from the distribution of the depths of shower maxima observed with the Pierre Auger Observatory: systematic uncertainties are studied in detail. Analysing the tail of the distribution of the shower maxima, a proton-air cross-section of \$[505\textbackslash{}pm22(stat)\^\{+28\}\_\{-36\}(sys)]\$ mb is found.},
