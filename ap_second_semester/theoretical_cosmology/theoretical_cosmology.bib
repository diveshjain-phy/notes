  abstract = {In mathematics and theoretical physics, a tensor is antisymmetric on (or with respect to) an index subset if it alternates sign (+/−) when any two indices of the subset are interchanged. The index subset must generally either be all covariant or all contravariant.
For example,

  
    
      
        
          T
          
            i
            j
            k
            …
          
        
        =
        −
        
          T
          
            j
            i
            k
            …
          
        
        =
        
          T
          
            j
            k
            i
            …
          
        
        =
        −
        
          T
          
            k
            j
            i
            …
          
        
        =
        
          T
          
            k
            i
            j
            …
          
        
        =
        −
        
          T
          
            i
            k
            j
            …
          
        
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle T\_\{ijk\textbackslash{}dots \}=-T\_\{jik\textbackslash{}dots \}=T\_\{jki\textbackslash{}dots \}=-T\_\{kji\textbackslash{}dots \}=T\_\{kij\textbackslash{}dots \}=-T\_\{ikj\textbackslash{}dots \}\}
  holds when the tensor is antisymmetric with respect to its first three indices.
If a tensor changes sign under exchange of each pair of its indices, then the tensor is completely (or totally) antisymmetric.  A completely antisymmetric covariant tensor of order p may be referred to as a p-form, and a completely antisymmetric contravariant tensor may be referred to as a p-vector.},

  abstract = {The problem of stationary, spherically symmetric accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole is discussed here with the use of a formalism which is completely consistent with Einstein's General theory of Relativity.

The transfer of heat is a significant part of this process, however treating it without approximations has proven difficult.
Here I explore the adiabatic case first; then I consider a more general case by assuming that all the heat transfer happens through electromagnetic radiation.
For the latter I apply the PSTF formalism which, roughly speaking, while still being relativistic allows for the decomposition of the radiation into its first moments: energy density and flux.

The numerical analysis of the differential equations the problem can be reduced to shows a bimodal behaviour: a branch of solutions has a much higher efficiency (ratio of luminosity to accretion rate) than another.

In order to treat this problem, first I briefly recall the formalism of general relativity; then I treat the basics of the relativistic formulation of the fluid dynamical equations, including the relativistic version of the Second Principle of thermodynamics.},
