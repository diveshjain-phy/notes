\section{GW perturbations}

\marginpar{Friday\\ 2020-5-29, \\ compiled \\ \today}

We have a background FLRW metric, and a perturbation to this spacetime. 

We need to be careful about the distinction between \emph{gauge} and \emph{coordinate} transformations. 
The former are the identity on the background spacetime, the latter are not. 

We classify the perturbations according to how they transform with respect to coordinate transformations in the background spacetime.
