As an explicit example of the theory we developed for an interacting QFT, we consider Quantum ElectroDynamics.

The Lagrangian is written as 
%
\begin{align}
\mathscr{L} = 
- \frac{1}{4} F^{\mu \nu } F_{\mu \nu }
+ \mathscr{L} _{\text{gauge-fixing}}
+ i q \overline{\psi} \qty(i\slashed{\DD} - M) \psi  
\,,
\end{align}
%
and it can be decomposed as \(\mathscr{L} = \mathscr{L}_{0} + \mathscr{L} _{\text{int}}\), with 
%
\begin{align}
\mathscr{L} _{\text{int}} = - q \overline{\psi} \gamma^{\mu } \psi A_{\mu } = - \mathscr{H} _{\text{int}}
\,.
\end{align}
