\section{Relativistic classical vector field}

\marginpar{Wednesday\\ 2020-6-10, \\ compiled \\ \today}

We want to write a relativistic field theory of particles such as the photon, which are vectors.
So, we require the vector transformation law under Lorentz transformations, 
%
\begin{align}
V^{\prime \mu } (x') = \tensor{\Lambda }{^{\mu }_{\nu }} V^{\nu } (x)
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\Lambda \in SO(1, 3)\) is a Lorentz transformation.
This theory will describe a spin-1 particle.
