\section{Nöther's theorem}

\marginpar{Monday\\ 2020-5-4, \\ compiled \\ \today}

We can relate symmetries and conserved quantities. 

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{symmetry} of the theory is the transformation of the fields and/or of the spacetime coordinates such that the equations of motion do not change.
\end{definition}

This is equivalent to saying that the action is stationary for the transformed fields iff it is stationary for the untransformed ones. 

The Lagrangian's symmetries are different from those of the EoM: for instance, we have shown that \(\mathscr{L} \to \mathscr{L} + \partial_{\mu } k^{\mu }\) preserves them, but the Lagrangian definitely changes.

Symmetries can be classified into \textbf{discrete} and \textbf{continuous} ones, depending on the group they correspond to. 
A \emph{discrete} group is a group which is endowed with the discrete topology --- the one in which all the subsets are open. 
A \emph{continuous} group, for what we will need, is a Lie group: one which is described as a differentiable manifold. 

The discrete groups we use are usually finite, but they can be inifinite: for instance, translations by \(\SI{1}{m}\) along a certain axis are isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}\).  
Continuous groups are always uncountably infinite, since at the very least they are described by one real parameter. 
Here, we are interested in continuous symmetries, since Nöther's theorem applies to them.

We classify these based on two characteristics: first, we have the \textbf{global} versus \textbf{local} symmetries.
Local symmetries' parameters depend on the position in spacetime, global symmetries' parameter are constant. 

\textbf{Spacetime} symmetries alter only the spacetime coordinates, \textbf{internal} symmetries alter the fields as well as the spacetime coordinates. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lorentz transformations \(x \to \Lambda x\) are global spacetime symmetries;
    \item general-relativistic diffeomorphisms \(x \to x'(x)\) are local spacetime symmetries;
    \item leptonic and hadronic number symmetries and flavour symmetry are global internal symmetries;
    \item gauge field symmetries like \(A_{\mu } \to A_{\mu } + \partial_{\mu } \Lambda \) are local internal symmetries. 
\end{enumerate}
