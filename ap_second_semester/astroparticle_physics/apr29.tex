\subsection{Neutrinos}

\marginpar{Wednesday\\ 2020-4-29, \\ compiled \\ \today}

The Yukawa Lagrangian is written as 
%
\begin{align}
\mathscr{L}_{\text{Yukawa}}
= - y_{e} L ^\dag_{a} \phi_{a} e_{R}
-y_{d} O ^\dag_{a} \phi_{a} d_{r}
-y_{a} O ^\dag_{a} \epsilon_{ab} \phi ^\dag_{b} u_{R} 
+ \text{h.c.}
\,.
\end{align}

Commonly this is written as \(\overline{\psi}_{L} \phi \psi_{R}\), this however does not mean \(\overline{\psi} = \psi ^\dag \gamma^{0}\), since it is applied to a 2-component spinor. 

The index \(a\) is an SU(2) index, and the Higgs field looks like 
%
\begin{align}
\phi = \left[\begin{array}{c}
\phi^{+} \\ 
\phi^{0}
\end{array}\right]
\,;
\end{align}
%
we have two terms like 
%
\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\nu_{L} & e^{-}_{L}
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\phi^{+} \\ 
\phi^{0}
\end{array}\right]
e_{R}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and also 
%
\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\nu_{R}^{c} & e^{+}_{R}
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\phi^{+} \\ 
\phi^{0}
\end{array}\right]
e_{R}^{-}
\,.
\end{align}

This means that the neutrino is massless: the VEV of \(\phi_{a}\) is 0 for \(\phi^{+}\), and \(v\) for \(\phi^{0}\). 
So, we get Dirac mass terms for the electron but not for the neutrino.

Ettore Majorana proposed a way to give a mass for the neutrino (or any neutral fermion, really).

The symmetries of the SM are, generally, \(\text{Lorentz} \otimes \text{Gauge}\).
We then write all the terms we can which are invariant under these. 

From these we can derive conservation laws, such as that for the Baryon number. We define 
%
\begin{align}
B(\text{Quark}) = \frac{1}{3} \qquad \text{and} \qquad
B(\text{antiQuark}) = - \frac{1}{3}
\,,
\end{align}
%
while for any other particle we assign 0.
This is conserved, but we need not impose it: the most general Lagrangian we write with our symmetries has it.
This is a global symmetry: \(U(1)_{B}\). 

The way to find it is to construct a baryonic current \(j^{\mu }_{B}\), in such a way that it is conserved in our Lagrangian, then the integral of \(j^{0}_{B}\) will give the conserved charge.

This has heavy consequences: the lightest baryon is the proton. If it were to decay, this would not conserve baryon number. 

If we are allowed to violate baryon number conservation we can have a decay like \(p \to e^{+ } + \gamma \), which would occur and destabilize atoms.

\todo[inline]{Recover a couple minutes}

We get a bound on the lifetime of the proton of 
%
\begin{align}
\tau _{\text{proton}} > \SI{e32}{yr}
\,.
\end{align}

We also have lepton number conservation.
This is more interesting since we have neutrinos, which are hard to detect.

We will see a method to give mass to neutrinos, which will however violate lepton number conservation.

Parity and charge are massively violated.

CP symmetry moves us from \(e^{-}_{L}\) to \(e^{+}_{L}\) to \((e^{+})_{R}\).

If we have CP symmetry, then if in our model we have a \(\nu_{L}\) we will also need to have a \(\nu^{c}_{R}\).
That is, there are only two degrees of freedom between them.

In the SM we introduce only left-handed neutrinos. However, we can also introduce 
%
\begin{align}
\nu_{R} \iff (\nu^{c})_{L}
\,.
\end{align}

The beta decay is always 
%
\begin{align}
n \to p + e^{-} + \overline{\nu}_{e}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we look at the spectrum of the energies of the electron. 

If the neutrinos are massless the curve gets to a certain point, if they are massive the curve stops a bit earlier. 
People have done this to a very high degree of precision.

What we have found up to now is \(m_{\nu_{e}} < \SI{2}{eV}\) in these beta decay experiments. 
The result that the neutrinos are massive did not come from here. 

From cosmic ray interactions we have charged pions, which decay into 
%
\begin{align}
\pi^{+} \to \mu^+ + \nu_{\mu }
\,.
\end{align}

Then, the muon decays into 
%
\begin{align}
\mu^+ \to e^{+} + \nu_{e} + \overline{\nu}_{\mu }
\,.
\end{align}

So, we expect twice as many \(\nu_{\mu }\) as \(\nu_{e}\).

We can build detectors in order to see these. We expect a muonic neutrino and antineutrino. 

The state \(\nu_{\mu }\) is a charge eigenstate, not a mass eigenstate: in general it will be written as \(a \nu_1 + b n_2 +c \nu_3 \).

Its time-evolution will then exhibit an oscillation in the probability to still find a \(\nu_{\mu }\), since the mass components oscillate at different frequencies.

The experiment OPERA found that some of the neutrinos from CERN going to Gran Sasso were converted to \(\nu_{\tau }\) and such. 

Also, Kamiokande found a ratio different from 2 of \(\nu_{\mu }\) to \(\nu_{e}\).

So, if there is an oscillation it means that the neutrinos must indeed be massive, or at least some of them must be.

We put a Dirac mass term for the \(\nu_{R}\): the mass will look like 
%
\begin{align}
m_{\nu } =  y_{\nu } v
\,.
\end{align}

But we know that the masses of the neutrinos are very small, from beta decay but also from structure formation in the early universe.

So, since \(v \sim \SI{100}{GeV}\) and \(m_{\nu } \lesssim \SI{1}{eV}\) we must have \(y_{\nu } \sim \num{e-11}\).

The Dirac mass term is 2+2 degrees of freedom. 

If \(L\) is a lepton doublet, we can write a term \(L \phi \).

However, \(L\) has an index: but we can consider a term 
%
\begin{align}
L^{i} \phi L^{j} \phi \epsilon_{ij}
\,.
\end{align}

We can do this for the neutrinos but not for the other particles since they are uncharged. 

So the term looks like 
%
\begin{align}
\nu_{L} \phi^{0} \nu_{L} \phi^{0}
\,.
\end{align}

When we compute the VEV we get a mass for the neutrino. 

This is for the left-handed neutrino. The dimension of this term is 5, since the fermions have dimension \(3/2\), while the Higgs has dimension 1: we should put a mass term in the denominator.
We will then have a term which looks like 
%
\begin{align}
y^2_{\nu } \frac{L L \phi^2}{M}
\,,
\end{align}
%
so that in the end \(m_{\nu } = y^2_{\nu } v^2 / M\).

This \(M\) must be very large in order to account for the small neutrino mass.

This is a sort of seesaw model: the mass matrix looks something like 
%
\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & m _{\text{Dirac}} \\ 
m _{\text{Dirac}} & M
\end{array}\right]
\,.
\end{align}

The thing is: \(\nu_{R}\) has no gauge numbers. 
The mass of the right-handed neutrino is not ``protected'' by the gauge symmetry, it can be as large as it likes. 

% If neutrinos possess a Majorana mass, 

It is important to find out whether the mass of the neutrino is due to a Majorana or Dirac mass term.

The experiments which can determine this are called \emph{neutrinoless double beta decay}.

If this were found, it would mean that neutrinos have a Majorana mass.

This concludes the discussion of the particle physics standard model. Next week we are going to start looking at the standard model of cosmology.
