Last time we stopped at the dilemma of beauty versus pragmatism.

How do we provide a mass to the \(W\) vector boson? 

% We could introduce an \(SU(2)\) symmetry. 

As we were discussing, we could add a mass term and write 
%
\begin{align}
\mathscr{L} = \mathscr{L} _{\text{Yang-Mills}} + M^2 W^{+}_{\mu } W^{\mu, -}
\,,
\end{align}
%
but this term \emph{brutally} breaks the symmetry.
This is explicit breaking of the symmetry. 

So, we introduce \textbf{Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking}. 
This is not exclusive to HEP: it happens in ferromagnets for example. As we cool them, at a certain stage all the spins align.

We cannot predict the direction along which the spins will align.

Let us introduce the Lagrangian of a scalar field \(\phi \): 
%
\begin{align}
\mathscr{L} = \qty(\partial^{\mu  } \phi^{*}(x)) \qty(\partial_{\mu } \phi (x)) 
+ \mu^2 \abs{\phi (x)}^2
+ \lambda^{4} \abs{\phi (x)}^{4}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and to find the ground state we can move to the Hamiltonian: 
%
\begin{align}
\mathscr{H} = \pi(x) \phi (x) - \mathscr{L}
\,.
\end{align}

The ground state is not symmetric under the whole symmetry of the Lagrangian.

There is a critical parameter: if \(\mu^2\) is positive we are in the symmetric phase of the system, if instead \(\mu^2\) is negative we transition to a new phase which is not symmetric.
The system still has the symmetry, but the ground state does not.

Why do we only have terms in \(\phi^2\) and \(\phi^{4}\)? we basically constructed the simplest potential which has the properties we want.

If \(\mu^2>0\) we can perturb around the state without the quartic term, which is described by the KG equation.

Goldstone theorem and VEV different from zero.
We have two problems which solve each other. 

If we explicitly break a \(U(1)\) global symmetry, we have a Goldstone boson. If we break a \(U(1)\) local symmetry, instead, we get a massless vector boson and a massless scalar.

The wonderful thing is that the two dof of the massless vector ad the single degree of freedom of the massless scalar couple to give a massive vector with three degrees of freedom.
This spontaneous breaking of local gauge symmetry is the \textbf{Higgs mechanism}.

It is a ``transmutation'' of degrees of freedom.
