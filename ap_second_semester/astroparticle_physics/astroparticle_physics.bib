  abstract = {How did the laws of physics made it possible that life evolved? How did intelligent life evolve? How come that human beings are here on Earth today? Are we unique, or are we just one of many intelligent species populating the Universe? It is likely that in the vastness of the Universe we humans do not stand alone. Recent surveys have detected thousands of extrasolar planets, many within the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars and consistent with rocky compositions and likely to contain secondary, volcanically outgassed atmospheres. In the near future we might be within reach of other forms of life and maybe of other civilizations; we must understand how to identify them, and, if possible, how to communicate with them. At the basis of all this is understanding what is life, and how it emerged on Earth and maybe elsewhere. The answer to these questions is written in the language of physics.},

  abstract = {The basic interactions affecting matter at the particle physics level are electromagnetism, strong interaction, and weak interaction. They can be unified by a Lagrangian displaying gauge invariance with respect to the SU(3) \textbackslash{}(\textbackslash{}otimes \textbackslash{}) SU(2) \textbackslash{}(\textbackslash{}otimes \textbackslash{}) U(1) local symmetry group; this unification is called the standard model of particle physics. Within the standard model, an elegant mechanism, called the Higgs mechanism, accounts for the appearance of masses of particles and of some of the gauge bosons. The standard model is very successful, since it brilliantly passed extremely accurate precision tests and several predictions have been confirmed-in particular, the Higgs particle has been recently discovered in the predicted mass range. However, it can hardly be thought as the final theory of nature: some physics beyond the standard model must be discovered to account for gravitation and to explain the energy budget of the Universe.},

  abstract = {Symmetry simplifies the description of physical phenomena, in such a way that humans can understand them: the Latin word for “understanding,” capere, also means “to contain”; and as we are a part of it we cannot contain the full Universe, unless we find a way to reduce its complexity–this is the meaning of symmetry. Symmetry plays a particularly important role in particle physics, as it does in astrophysics and in cosmology. The key mathematical framework for symmetry is group theory: symmetry transformations form groups. Although the symmetries of a physical system are not sufficient to fully describe its behavior—for this purpose, one needs a complete dynamical theory—it is possible to use symmetry to discover fundamental properties of a system. Examples of symmetries include space–time symmetries, internal symmetries of particles, and the so-called gauge symmetries of field theories.},

Due to their low interaction probability, they are very difficult to detect and as a consequence the neutrino sector is the least known in the standard model of particle physics. In the late 1990s it has been discovered that neutrinos of different flavors (electron, muon, or tau) “oscillate”: neutrinos created with well-defined leptonic flavor may be detected in another flavor eigenstate. This phenomenon implies that neutrinos have a non-zero—although tiny even for the standards of particle physics—mass.},
