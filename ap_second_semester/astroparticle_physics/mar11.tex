\chapter{The particle physics Standard Model}

\marginpar{Wednesday\\ 2020-3-11, \\ compiled \\ \today}

For this lecture, a good reference is Peskin, chapter 2 \cite{peskinConceptsElementaryParticle2019}.

We wish to describe what we described yesterday as ``matter'' and ``radiation''.

The problem is similar to the one we have in classical mechanics, an initial value problem: given the positions and velocities of the particles at a certain starting time \(t_0 \) we wish to compute their state at a later time \(t\).

This classical description in which the particles are not wavelike fails at the microscopic level: we want to give a quantum description of such a system of particles. 
We will derive it from the classical description using the standard tools of quantization. 
We start with a refresher of the classical description.

\subsection{The classical description of a system of particles}

Our aim is to compute and solve the equations of motion.
The usual approach is to use Hamilton's variational principle: it is the principle of least action, but it is not usually referred to as such: we are actually not \emph{minimizing} the action but finding a \emph{stationary point} for it.
This could also be a maximum or a saddle point.

The action functional \(S\) depends on the coordinates \(q_i(t)\) of the particles at at time \(t\), on the derivatives of these positions \(\dot{q}_{i}(t)\) which represent the velocities of the particles at a time \(t\). 
We usually write \(S \qty[q_{i}(t), \dot{q}_{i}(t)]\). 

If we fix \(q(t_0 )\) and \(q(t_{f})\), the positions at some initial and final time \(t_f\), we can then trace out a path \(q(t)\) and perturb it by \(\delta q(t)\); we fix \(\delta q(t_0 ) = \delta q(t_f) = 0\). 

Under this perturbation of the path \(q \rightarrow q + \delta q\), the action changes to \(S \rightarrow S + \delta S\). 
We then ask that \(\delta S =0\). 

\(S\) is an action: is dimensions are those of an energy times a time. 
In terms of the Lagrangian \(L\), the action is defined as 
%
\begin{align}
S \qty[q_i(t), \dot{q}_{i}(t)] = \int_{t_0 }^{t_f} L (q_i (t), \dot{q}_{i}(t)) \dd{t}
\,,
\end{align}
%
which means that the Lagrangian must have the dimensions of an energy. 
We will make use of a quantity called the Lagrangian density: 
%
\begin{align}
L = \int \mathscr{L} \qty(\phi (\vec{x}), \partial_{\mu } \phi (\vec{x})) \dd[3]{x}
\,.
\end{align}

From a finite number of particles we move to considering a field \(\phi (\vec{x})\): this means that, in a certain sense, we are considering an infinite number of particles. 

The dependence of the Lagrangian on the \(q_i\) and \(\dot{q}_{i}\) shifted to a dependence on the spacetime coordinates \(x\) and their 4-derivatives \(\partial_{\mu } x\).
It could depend on many fields simultaneously, we omit this dependence for simplicity.
Now, this Lagrangian density has the dimensions of an energy per unit volume. 

Then, the action, computed in a region \(\Omega \) of 4-dimensional spacetime, is 
%
\begin{align}
S = \int_{\Omega } \dd[4]{x} \mathscr{L} \qty(\phi (x), \partial_{\mu } (\phi (x)))
\,.
\end{align}

Now that we have established the notation, we can apply the action principle: we consider an infinitesimal variation of the field \(\phi \rightarrow \phi  + \delta \phi \). 
We require this variation to vanish not only at the initial and final time, but over all the boundary \(\partial \Omega \): 
%
\begin{align}
\eval{\delta \phi }_{\partial \Omega } =0
\,.
\end{align}

Then, imposing \(\delta S =0\) is equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange equations: 
%
\begin{align}
\pdv{\mathscr{L}}{\phi (x)} - \pdv{}{x^{\mu }} \qty(\pdv{\mathscr{L}}{\qty(\partial_{\mu} \phi (x))}) = 0
\,.
\end{align}

If we have many fields \(\phi_{r}\), then we have a set of E-L equations for each of them. 
This is still classical: for example, classical (relativistic) electrodynamics is formulated in this way.

The momenta are 
%
\begin{align}
\pi (x) = \pdv{\mathscr{L}}{\dot{\phi} (x)}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where a dot denotes a time derivative
and using this we define the Hamiltonian density by 
%
\begin{align}
\mathscr{H} (x) = \pi (x) \dot{\phi} (x) - \mathscr{L}(\phi, \partial_{\mu }\phi )
\,,
\end{align}
%
and similarly to the Lagrangian we have the full Hamiltonian \(H\)
%
\begin{align}
H = \int \dd[3]{x} \mathscr{H}
\,.
\end{align}

Now, these fields (\(\phi \) and \(\pi \)) are classical fields: we will apply classical quantization to them. 
They will need to satisfy the classical commutation relations: 
%
\begin{align}
\qty[\phi (\vec{x}, t), \pi (\vec{x}', t)] &= i \hbar \delta (\vec{x} - \vec{x}')  \\
\qty[\phi (\vec{x}, t), \phi  (\vec{x}', t)] &=
\qty[\pi (\vec{x}, t), \pi  (\vec{x}', t)] = 0
\,.
\end{align}

\subsection{A relativistic reminder}


the energy-momentum four-vector is 
%
\begin{align}
p^{\mu } = \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
E & \vec{p} c
\end{array}\right]
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the greek index \(\mu \) can take values from 0 to 3. 

The metric signature used here is the the mostly minus one. So, \(p^{\mu } q_{\mu } = E_{p} E_{q} - \vec{p} \cdot \vec{q}\), since we raise and lower indices using the metric \(\eta_{\mu \nu }\). 

The square norm of the 4-momentum is \(p \cdot p  = p^2 = E^2 - \abs{p}^2 c^2\). It is Lorentz invariant.

In the rest frame of the observer, \(p^{\mu } = \qty[E_{0}, \vec{0}]\), and this \(E_0\) is just (\(c^2\) times)
 the mass of the particle: this is the \emph{definition} of mass. 

When the relation is satisfied we have 
%
\begin{align}
p^2 &= E^2 - \abs{p}^2 c^2= \qty(mc^2)^2  \\
E &= c \sqrt{\abs{p}^2 + (mc)^2}
\,.
\end{align}

% \todo[inline]{There is an extra \(c\) in the notes.}

When this relation is satisfied we say we are \emph{on shell}: for virtual particles, instead, this might not be satisfied.

We will use natural units: \(\hbar = c = 1\). 

This means that we equate energies (\SI{}{eV}) and angular velocities (\SI{}{Hz}); also we equate times (\SI{}{s}) and lengths (\SI{}{m}). 

The rest energy of the electron is \(m_e \approx \SI{511}{keV}\). 
Let us consider an electron with a momentum \(p\) of the order of its mass \(m_e\): then, its uncertainty in position is of the order 
%
\begin{align}
\frac{\hbar}{p c} \approx \frac{1}{m_e} \approx \SI{4e-11}{cm}
\,.
\end{align}

The dimensions of the lagrangian density, in natural units, are those of an energy to the fourth power, or a length to the \(-4\), or a mass to the fourth. 

Another useful exercise is to calculate the coupling of the electromagnetic field: 
%
\begin{align}
V(r) = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi } \frac{1}{r} 
\,,
\end{align}
%
since we set \(\epsilon_{0} = \mu_0 = 1\). 
We can introduce the electromagnetic \(\alpha \): this is 
%
\begin{align}
\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi } \times \frac{1}{\hbar c} 
\,.
\end{align}

This then becomes adimensional: \(\alpha \approx 1 / 137\). 
It represents the strength of the electromagnetic interaction: the strength of the coupling of the photon to the electron.  
The fact that it is \(\sim \num{e-2}\) is important: it allows us to work in a perturbative way, in powers of \(\alpha \). 

What is the coupling of the strong and weak interactions? This will be discussed.

Next time, we will discuss symmetries and symmetry breaking.
