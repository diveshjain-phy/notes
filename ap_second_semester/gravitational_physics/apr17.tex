\section{Noise theory}

\subsubsection{A simple experiment}

\marginpar{Friday\\ 2020-4-17, \\ compiled \\ \today}

In order to guide our description of noise theory, we start from a simple example: suppose we want to use a pendulum to measure the gravitational acceleration \(g\).
We want to use small oscillations, which should satisfy \(g \approx \omega^2L\), and we want to fit \(a(t)\).

Our signal can be very noisy compared to the theoretical waveform.
If we perform a \textbf{precision experiment} then the magnitude of the noise is comparable to (or smaller than) that of the signal: this is not a bad thing necessarily, it means we are operating at the very limit of our experimental capabilities. 

It \emph{is} a good idea to fit the whole timeseries instead of just counting oscillations, since we are using more data then. 

\subsection{Noise in experiments: a general formulation}

The physical system gives us a signal \(s(t)\), we have some measurement apparatus which gives us an output \(s'(t)\).

The output \(s'(t)\) can be also affected by noise: we can have physical noise \(n_1 (t)\) in the form of a \emph{random concurrent phenomenon}, noise \(n_2 (t)\) in the \emph{transducer}, and \(n_3 (t)\) in the \emph{readout}. The term \(n_1 \) comes from the phenomenon itself, the terms \(n_2\) and \(n_3 \) come from our measurement apparatus.  
This is a description of a very simple system, real-world experiments often are even more complicated than this! 

In our example: \(n_1 \) could be due to air currents or vibrations of the suspension points.
The transducer in our case is the accelerometer, so we can have input voltage instability, imperfect mechanical coupling, thermal vibrations contributing to \(n_2 \). 
In the readout noise \(n_3 \) we can have reference voltage instability, quantization if we digitize the signal, and electronic pick-up.

Also, in the signal \(s(t)\) there could be phenomena we do not want to measure and would regard as noise! 

% We want to distinguish the output signal \(s'\) from the output noise \(n'\).

% We define \textbf{precision experiments} as experiments where the signal amplitude is generally comparable or smaller than the noise amplitude.

We call \textbf{noise} any unwanted signal. 
In the classical realm, \(n(t)\) is the sum of deterministic processes, but in practice it is random since there are so many of them. We usually assume that they are zero-mean, while \(s(t)\) is macroscopically deterministic.

The question the experimenter must ask are: how do we \textbf{distinguish} signal from noise, and how can we \textbf{recover} the original signal? How do we \textbf{characterize} the noise in a given experiment? 

\subsection{Random processes}

A random variable is a number \(x\) associated to a possible experimental outcome. Any outcome has an associated probability.
In the continuous realm, this is described by a probability density function \(f(x)\), defined so that: 
%
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P} (x_0 \leq x \leq x_1 ) =  \int_{x_0 }^{x_1 } f(x) \dd{x}
\,,
\end{align}
%
which we can use to compute mean values:
%
\begin{align}
\int g(x) f(x) \dd{x} = \expval{g(x)}_{f}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and variances:
%
\begin{align}
\sigma^2  &= \int \dd{x} f(x) \qty(x - \expval{x})^2 = \expval{(x - \expval{x})^2} = \expval{x^2} - \expval{x}^2
\,.
\end{align}

Do note that at this point these are \emph{ensemble averages}: what we expect to be the average of a sample, \emph{not} time averages. 
The way to ideally compute the ensemble average of a signal would be to repeat the experiment an ``infinite number of times''. 

A random signal is a time series \(x(t)\); every time we repeat the experiment we get a new realization of \(x(t)\). 

Knowing \(x(\widetilde{t})\) at a specific time \(\widetilde{t}\) we only have \emph{partial} predictive power for \(x(\widetilde{t} + T)\). 

At a fixed time \(t\), the possible values of \(x(t)\) have a certain probability distribution \(f(x; t)\).
Then we can define the following functions of time: \(\mu (t) = \expval{x(t)}\) and \(\sigma^2(t)\). 

% Ideally these are averages over an infinite number of realizations.

Some properties our signal can have are: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{stochasticity}: the noise results from many uncorrelated processes, and correlation between the signal at a time \(t\) and at a time \(t + \Delta t\) decreases quickly with \(\Delta t\);
    \item \textbf{ergodicity}: this means that instead of an ensemble mean value we can compute a time average, and similarly for other statistical properties; 
    \item \textbf{stationarity}: statistical properties are time-independent;
    \item \textbf{gaussianity}: \(x(t)\) is normally distributed for a  fixed \(t\). 
\end{enumerate}

The assumption of gaussianity for a specific signal is qualitatively justified by the central limit theorem, as long as the noise signal is stochastic. 

The assumption of stationarity is not justified in general: there are several seasonal and daily phenomena which can alter the experimental apparatus; it is important to tread carefully here and only apply this assumption for small enough times.

Apart from this last consideration, these assumptions are almost always made in order to analyze the signal, but it is important to keep them in mind.

% We assume that the noise is \textbf{stochastic}, so it results from many different uncorrelated processes, and the correlation between the noise at a time \(t\) and \(t + \Delta t\) decreases quickly with \(\Delta t\). 

% \todo[inline]{So, we meand that the noise is high-frequency?}

% \textbf{Stationarity}: the apparatus is stable in time, and so are the processes that generate the noise.
% This is valid only for somewhat small periods. 

\subsection{Fourier transforms}

In order to move to Fourier space we must make sure that our time signal \(s(t)\) is square-integrable: 
%
\begin{align}
\int \abs{s(t)}^2 \dd{t} < \infty 
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the integration bounds are implied to be \(- \infty \) to \(\infty \), unless otherwise specified. 

As long as this is the case, we can define the Fourier transform and antitransform:  
%
\begin{align}
s(\omega ) = \int s(t) e^{-i \omega t} \dd{t}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
s(t) = \frac{1}{2 \pi } \int s(\omega ) e^{i \omega t} \dd{\omega } 
\,.
\end{align}

The normalization factors before the integrals are conventional --- their product however needs to be \((2 \pi )^{-1}\) in order for the composition of the transform and antitransform to give back the original function. 
The signs of the arguments of the exponentials could be swapped as well, they just need to be opposite of each other. 

Important properties are: linearity; the fact that in Fourier space derivatives become multiplication by \(i \omega \);\footnote{This can be shown by integrating by parts, the boundary terms must vanish since our function is in \(L^2(\mathbb{R})\).}
the convolution theorem: multiplication in time domain is the same as convolution in frequency domain,
%
\begin{align}
\int s(t) q(t) e^{-i \omega t} \dd{t} = \frac{1}{2 \pi } \int s(\omega') q (\omega - \omega') \dd{\omega'}
\,.
\end{align}

The transform of the Dirac \(\delta(t) \) function is 1: a signal which is very well localized in time is very delocalized in frequency (and vice versa).
The Fourier transform corresponds to a \emph{unitary} transformation of the space of square-integrable functions: no information is lost by transforming, so under these assumptions any signal can be described as an infinite superposition of oscillatory terms in an equivalent. 

The transform is a complex-valued function, telling us the amplitude and phase of any component of the oscillation.

In practice, the frequency domain is very useful. Many interesting signals are well-defined in frequency, less so in time.

% Even multiple signals can be easily separated in frequency. 
Also, random noise is easier to characterize in frequency domain, especially if it is \emph{stationary}: the specific value of the noise at a specific time is random, but the statistics of the Fourier transform are fixed.

Some other properties: the Fourier transform preserves the energy (in the sense of the integral of the square modulus): \(\int \abs{s(t)}^2 \dd{t} = \int \abs{s(\omega )}^2 \dd{\omega }\). 
% It also preserves the information.

If the signal \(s(t)\) is real-valued, then we have \(s(\omega ) = s^{*}(- \omega )\), so all the information is contained in the \(\omega > 0\) part of the transform.

We can associate a \emph{probability density} to the signal, by 
%
\begin{align}
f(t) = \frac{\abs{s(t)}^2}{\int \dd{t} \abs{s(t)}^2}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
f(\omega) = \frac{\abs{s(\omega)}^2}{\int \dd{\omega} \abs{s(\omega)}^2}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we can compute the moments of this probability density like we would for any other PDF.
The \textbf{average values} of \(\omega \) and \(t\) (can be made to) \textbf{vanish}: for the frequency we have 
%
\begin{align}
\expval{\omega } = \int \dd{\omega } \omega f(\omega )
\propto \int \dd{\omega } \omega \abs{s(\omega )}^2 
\,,
\end{align}
%
which is odd under \(\omega \to - \omega \), since \(s(- \omega ) = s(\omega )^{*}\), whose square modulus is the same. 
For the time, on the other hand, we will in general have some nonzero result:
%
\begin{align}
\expval{t} = \int \dd{t} t f(t) = t_0 
\,,
\end{align}
%
which can be made to vanish by shifting \(t\) by \(t_0 \). 

On the other hand, the second moments are nonvanishing: they are defined by 
%
\begin{align}
\expval{\omega^2} = \Delta \omega^2 = \int \dd{\omega } \omega^2 f(\omega ) = \frac{\int \dd{\omega } \abs{\dv{s(t)}{t}}^2}{\int \dd{t} \abs{s(t)}^2}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\expval{t^2} = \Delta t^2 = \int \dd{t } t^2 f(t )
\,.
\end{align}

We have the uncertainty principle, giving an intrinsic trade off between the localization of a signal in momentum space and in position space:\footnote{In order to prove this result, one writes \(\Delta \omega^2 \Delta t^2 \) explicitly and applies the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality: with \(E = \int \abs{s(\omega )}^2 \dd{\omega }\) we can write
%
\begin{align}
\Delta \omega^2 \Delta t^2 
= \frac{1}{E^2} \int \dd{t} \abs{\dv{s}{t}}^2
 \int \dd{t'} t^{\prime 2} \abs{s(t')}^2 \geq \frac{1}{E^2} \abs{\int t \dv{s}{t} s(t) \dd{t}}^2 
 = \frac{1}{4 E^2} \abs{\int t \dv{}{t} \qty(s^2)  \dd{t} }^2  
 = \frac{1}{4}
\,,
\end{align}
%
since \(\int t \dv{(s^2)}{t} \dd{t} = - \int s^2 \dd{t} = - E\). 
}
%
\begin{align}
\Delta \omega \Delta t \geq \frac{1}{2} 
\,.
\end{align}

Depending on the physical characteristics of the signal, we should select a large observation time or a large frequency band, knowing that with a short observation time we will not be able to determine a frequency precisely.    

\subsection{Power spectral density}

The phase of the noise will be completely different from one realization to the other: if the noise is stochastic then its Fourier transform is stochastic as well. 

We define the autocorrelation function: for a \emph{stationary process} it is given by
%
\begin{align}
R(t, t')  = \expval{x(t) x(t')} = R(\tau =  t - t') 
\,.
\end{align}

This function measures how quickly the signal loses memory. For a random process we expect \(R\) to go to zero relatively quickly as \(\tau \) increases. 
So, we define the power spectral density (PSD) as the \textbf{Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function}: 
%
\begin{align}
S_x (\omega ) = \int  \dd{\tau } R(\tau ) e^{i \omega \tau } 
\,.
\end{align}

White noise has no correlation between a point and another: its auto-correlation function is a delta. It has all the frequency components. So, its PSD will be flat.
% The autocorrelation function measures how fast the signal loses memory. 

A more loose and intuitive definition is the \emph{ensemble average} of the frequency components of the signal: 
%
\begin{align}
S_x(\omega ) \delta (\omega - \omega') = \expval{x(\omega ) x^{*} (\omega')}
\,,
\end{align}
%
so that we can recover the power of the signal by integrating it \cite[eq.\ 7.12]{maggioreGravitationalWavesVolume2007}: 
%
\begin{align}
\expval{s^2} = \int S_x (\omega ) \dd{\omega }
\,.
\end{align}

This is not the formal definition since \(x(\omega )\) may not exist, but it clarifies the meaning: the phase of the signal is randomly distributed, but its \emph{amplitude} has a well-defined average. 

% It is the average of the amplitude square, which is a power.

If we build a window filter which only allows \([\omega_1 \leq \omega \leq \omega_2 ]\), then the residual power will be 
%
\begin{align}
P _{\text{window}} = \int_{\omega_1 }^{\omega_2 } S(\omega ) \dd{\omega }
\,.
\end{align}

For real signals, \(S\) is symmetric: \(S_x (-\omega ) = S_x (\omega )\). 
If we do not care about negative frequencies, we keep only the \([\omega \geq_0 ]\) region and multiply by 2.

The mean square of the signal in time is the integral of the PSD: 
%
\begin{align}
\sigma^2_{x} = \int_{0}^{ \infty } S_x (\omega )
\,.
\end{align}

% Here we are assuming that the signal has zero mean.
If two signals are uncorrelated, the power spectral density of their sum is the sum of their PSDs: 
%
\begin{align}
S_{x + y} (\omega ) = S_x (\omega ) + S_y (\omega )
\,.
\end{align}
%

Often instead of the \emph{power} spectral density we use the amplitude, or linear, spectral density, defined by \(\sqrt{S_x(\omega )}\). 

If our signal has units of \SI{}{m}, then the dimensions of the power spectral density are \([S_x(\omega )] = \SI{}{m^2/Hz}\), while the linear PSD has units of \([\sqrt{S_x(\omega )}] = \SI{}{m / \sqrt{Hz}}\).

\subsubsection{PSD, bandwidth and windowing}

In practice, we measure for a limited time \(T\), either because the funding runs out or because the signal has an intrinsically short duration.
So, the measured signal \(x(t)\) will only have Fourier components at frequencies \(f_n = n / T\), where \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).
We express this by saying that the frequency resolution is \(\Delta f = 1 / T\). 

In general, we express a time-constrained measurement as a product of the signal \(x(t)\) with a window \(w(t)\), so that the measured signal is \(x(t) w(t)\), where the window \(w(t)\) is only nonzero in a certain region of length \(\leq T\).
In frequency space products become convolutions, so we get 
%
\begin{align}
x _{\text{measured}} (\omega ) = \int \dd{\widetilde{\omega}} x(\widetilde{\omega}) w(\omega - \widetilde{\omega} ) 
\,:
\end{align}
%
the Fourier transform of the window \emph{spreads out} our signal.
We must also be careful: windows with sharp boundaries (like a box window) introduce high-frequency components, dirtying the Fourier representation of our signal.
In order to avoid this effect we must ``ease into'' the window somehow, for example we can consider a window shaped like a Gaussian. 
Counterintuitively, this means that we must \emph{ignore} or consider less some of our data points. 

We could deconvolve to get the signal back if we knew what the window looks like. We often know all about the window, but we do not usually apply this procedure. 
In fact, if we were to take out this windowing effect it would mean we are assuming that if we were to observe our signal \emph{for a longer time than we actually did} we would see the same thing over and over.

This is quite a strong assumption, which might be justified sometimes, but usually it is not.
