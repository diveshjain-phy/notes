% \todo[inline]{Recover ten minutes}
It is interesting to consider the fundamental mode for the oscillator, which is given by setting \(n =0\): this yields 
%
\begin{align}
\ddot{\xi}_{0} + \omega_0^2 \xi_{n} = \frac{2L}{\pi^2} \ddot{h}^{TT}_{xx}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\omega_0 = \pi v_s /L\). 
The total energy in the bar can be recovered from this mode, by 
%
\begin{align}
E = \frac{M}{4} \qty(\dot{\xi}_{0}^2 + \omega_0^2 \xi_0^2 )
= \frac{1}{2} \int \dd{m} \qty(\dot{u}^2 + v_s^2 \qty(\pdv{u}{x})^2)
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(M\) is the total mass of the bar. This basically amounts to integrating \(1/2 m v^2\), where \(v\) is calculated including both temporal and spatial variations. 

The equation for this fundamental mode has the same form as the one of a simple harmonic oscillator, whose mass is \(m_0 = M/2\), whose frequency is \(\omega_0 \) and which is subject to an effective force 
%
\begin{align} \label{eq:effective-force-harmonic-oscillator-bar-fundamental}
F(t) = \frac{2  m_0  L}{\pi^2} \ddot{h}_{xx}^{TT} = \frac{LM}{\pi^2}
\ddot{h}^{TT}_{xx}
\,.
\end{align}

Like we did in the harmonic oscillator case we introduce a damping term to model the physical imperfections in the resonance: then the equation will read 
%
\begin{align} \label{eq:damped-zeroth-mode-resonant-bar}
\ddot{\xi}_{0} + \gamma_0 \dot{\xi}_{0} + \omega_0^2 \xi_0 = \frac{2L}{\pi^2} \ddot{h}^{TT}_{xx}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\gamma_0 = \omega_0 / Q_0 \). 
After Fourier-transforming we find 
%
\begin{align} \label{eq:transfer-function-resonant-bar-fundamental}
\xi_0 (\omega ) 
&= \frac{2L}{\pi^2} \frac{\ddot{h}_{xx}^{TT} (\omega )}{\omega^2- \omega_0 ^2 - i \omega \gamma_0 }  \\
&= \underbrace{-\frac{2L}{\pi^2} \frac{\omega^2}{\omega^2- \omega_0 ^2 - i \omega \gamma_0 }}_{H_{h \to \xi_0 } (\omega )}  h_{xx}^{TT} (\omega )
\,,
\end{align}
%
so we have the expression from the transfer function, allowing us to quantify the response of the system to the oscillatory stimulus of the GW. 

Typical values for the parameters at play are a length of \(L \sim \SI{3}{m}\), a mass of \(M \sim \SI{2e3}{kg}\) and a speed of sound of the order \(v_s \sim \SI{5e3}{m/s}\), which means we have a characteristic frequency of the order of \(\omega_0 \sim \SI{5e3}{rad / s}\), so the long-wavelength approximation is valid. 

The value of the decay parameter \(Q_0 \) is of the order \num{e6} typically, which means that the characteristic time for an oscillation to die out is of the order \(\tau_0 \sim 1/ \gamma_0 = Q_0 / \omega_0 \sim \num{e2} \divisionsymbol \SI{e3}{s}\): oscillations need \textbf{several minutes to die out}. 

This only applies when \(\omega \) from the GW is \textbf{very close} to \(\omega_0 \), as the transfer function is very peaked. 
% Resonant bars are resonant: their transfer function is very much peaked. 

% The transfer function is the response to the strain as a function of signal frequency.

\subsubsection{Response to periodic signals}

If we have an incoming GW propagating along the \(z\) axis, while the bar is positioned along the \(x\) axis, then the GW amplitude will be described by 
%
\begin{align}
h_{xx}^{TT} (t, z) = h_0 \Re[\exp(-i \omega (t - z/c))]
\,,
\end{align}
%
so, fixing \(z =0 \) for simplicity (and without losing generality, it is only a phase shift) its second derivative is 
%
\begin{align}
\ddot{h}_{xx}^{TT} = - \omega^2 h_0 \Re[\exp(-i \omega t)]
\,.
\end{align}

A steady-state solution to the coupled differential equation \eqref{eq:damped-zeroth-mode-resonant-bar} is:
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (t) &= \frac{2L \omega^2 h_0 }{\pi^2}
\Re \qty[\frac{\exp(-i \omega t)}{\omega^2 - \omega_0^2 + i \omega \gamma_0 }] \\
&= \frac{2 L \omega^2 h_0 }{\pi^2} \frac{(\omega^2 - \omega^2_{0}) \cos(\omega t) - \gamma_0 \sin(\omega t)}{(\omega^2-\omega_0^2)^2 + \omega^2 \gamma_0^2}
\,,
\end{align}
%
which has a simpler expression in Fourier space:
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (\omega ) = - \frac{2L}{\pi^2} \frac{\omega^2}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - i \omega \gamma_0 } h_0 \delta (\omega )
\,.
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Response to bursts}

It is a fact from classical mechanics that the absorbed energy \(E\) of an oscillator with mass \(m_0 \) subject to an external impulsive force \(F(t)\) is:\footnote{The reference from Maggiore is to Landau and Liftsis, volume 1, equation 22.12.} 
%
\begin{align}
E 
= \frac{1}{2 m_0 } \abs{ \int_{ - \infty }^{ \infty  } F(t) e^{-i \omega_0 t} \dd{t}}^2
\,,
\end{align}
%
so if we suppose our force has the form \(F(t) = (2 / \pi^2) m_0 L \ddot{h}_{xx}\), where \(m_0 = M/2\) (both of these come from what we found for the equivalence to a simple harmonic oscillator of the fundamental mode of the resonant bar, \eqref{eq:effective-force-harmonic-oscillator-bar-fundamental}), we find
%
\begin{align}
E = \frac{ML^2}{\pi^{4} } \abs{ \int_{ - \infty }^{ \infty  } \ddot{h}_{xx}^{TT}(t) e^{-i \omega_0 t} \dd{t}}^2
\,,
\end{align}
%
and since the force is impulsive \(h(t)\) goes to zero quickly for \(t \to \pm \infty \), so we can integrate by parts twice: 
%
\begin{align}
E &= \frac{M L^2 (2 \pi f_0 )^{4}}{\pi^{4}} 
\abs{\int_{- \infty }^{\infty} \dd{t} h_{xx}^{TT} (t) e^{-i \omega_0 t}}^2  \\
&= 16 M L^2 f_0^{4} \abs{h_{xx}^{TT} (f_0 )}^2
\,,
\end{align}
%
since the integral is precisely the Fourier transform of \(h(t)\) evaluated at \(f_0\).
This is the energy of the GW component at frequency \(\omega_0 \): we can invert this expression to recover the energy of the component of the GW at a frequency \(f_0 \) from the energy we measure at the detector, \(E\): 
%
\boxalign{
\begin{align}
\abs{h_{xx}^{TT} (f_0 )}^2 = \frac{1}{16L^2 f_0^{4}} \frac{E}{M}
\,.
\end{align}}

\subsubsection{Ringdown}

The transfer function in \eqref{eq:transfer-function-resonant-bar-fundamental} can be written as 
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (\omega ) = - \frac{2L}{\pi^2} \frac{\omega^2}{(\omega - \omega_{+}) (\omega-\omega_{-})} h^{TT}_{xx} (\omega )
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the frequencies \(\omega_{\pm}\) are defined by: 
%
\begin{align}
\omega_{\pm} = \pm \sqrt{\omega_0 ^2 - \qty(\frac{\gamma_0 }{2})^2} - i \frac{\gamma_0 }{2} \approx \pm \omega_0 - i \frac{\gamma_0 }{2}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the approximation holds when the quality factor \(Q = \omega_0 / \gamma_0 \) is large. 

\todo[inline]{The minus sign in this equation is not there in Maggiore! Should check all signs here\dots}

We suppose that the incoming burst is a delta in time: then, its spectral decomposition will be uniform.
Specifically, let us rescale it so that it has the same integral (so, the same energy) as a rectangular impulse: 
%
\begin{align}
h_{xx }^{TT} (t) = h_0 \tau_{GW} \delta (t) \implies h_{xx}^{TT} (\omega ) = h_0 \tau_{GW}
\,.
\end{align}

Then, we get 
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (t) &= \int \frac{ \dd{\omega }}{2 \pi } \xi_0 (\omega ) e^{-i \omega t}
\\
&= \frac{2L}{\pi^2} h_0 \tau_{GW} \int_{- \infty }^{ \infty } \frac{ \dd{\omega }}{2 \pi } \frac{\omega^2}{(\omega - \omega_{+}) (\omega-\omega_{-})} e^{-i \omega t}  \\
&\approx \frac{2L }{\pi^2} h_0 \omega_0 \tau_{GW} e^{-\gamma_0 t / 2} \sin(\omega_0 t)
\,.
\end{align}

\todo[inline]{Probably the integral is solved by looking at the complex residuals\dots }

The GW ``burst'' excites the fundamental mode, which then decays with a characteristic time \(1/ \gamma_0 \). 

By saying that the signal is a delta, do we mean that \(\tau_{GW} \ll 1 / \omega_0 \)?
Yes, where \(\omega_0 \) is the frequency of the oscillator, which is much faster than the characteristic frequency of the dissipation. 

\subsubsection{Antenna pattern}

The sensitivity of the detector depends both on the direction from which the GW comes and the polarization.

If \(\vec{J}\) is the orientation of the bar, then we have 
%
\begin{align}
h _{\text{out}} = \hat{J}^{i} \hat{J}^{j} h_{ij} (t)
\,.
\end{align}

Let us consider a ``detector-centric'' reference frame in which the bar is along the \(x\) axis, while the source is positioned in the \(xz\) plane (this is fully general, we rotate around the \(x\) axis until the condition is satisfied).
Let us also consider a ``source-centric'' reference frame in which the \(z'\) axis points towards the source of the GW, while the \(x' z'\) plane coincides with the \(xz\) one.

Since these two planes coincide, the \(\hat{y}\) vector also will: we will be able to move between the two references with a rotation around it, 
%
\begin{align}
R = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\cos \alpha  & 0 & \sin \alpha  \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
- \sin \alpha  & 0 & \cos \alpha 
\end{array}\right]
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\alpha = \pi /2 - \theta \), and \(\theta \) is the angle between the bar and the observation direction. 

If we consider the polarizations of the GW to be expressed with respect to the primed frame: 
%
\begin{align}
h_{ij}' = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
h_{+} & h_{ \times } & 0 \\ 
h_{ \times } & -h_{+} & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\,,
\end{align}
%
then by applying the rotation matrix (twice, once for each index) we will see:
%
\begin{align}
h _{\text{out}} = h_{xx} = 
R_{1k} R_{1l} h_{kl}'
= h_{+} \sin^2\theta 
\,.
\end{align}

This reference for the source is rather restrictive; we might want to align our axes so that a binary system is more easily described. 

To move to a generic source reference frame, we must a rotation of angle \(\varphi \) around the axis \(z'\) of the source system, so that the \(x' z'\) plane is free to differ from the \(xz\) one. 

With this generalization, we find:
%
\begin{align}
h _{\text{out}} (t) = h_{+}' \sin^2\theta \cos 2 \varphi + h_{ \times }' \sin^2 \theta \sin 2 \varphi 
\,,
\end{align}
%
which means, as we could have expected intuitively, that the detector is most sensitive to sources whose directions are perpendicular to its bar, while it is blind to sources which are positioned parallel to the bar. 

\subsubsection{Resonant amplification}

The response of the bar is quite small: we cannot really measure it; however we can transfer the energy to a lighter oscillator called the \textbf{transducer}, which will move more. 
The coupled equations of motion read: 
%
\begin{align}
\ddot{\xi}_{0} + \omega_0^2 \xi_0 + \mu \omega_{t}^2 \qty(\xi_0 - \xi_t)
&= \frac{F_0}{m_0 }  \\
\ddot{\xi}_{t} + \mu \omega_{t}^2 \qty(\xi_0 - \xi_t) &= \frac{F_t}{m_t}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the label \(t\) refers to the transducer while \(0\) is the fundamental mode of the resonant bar, and \(\mu \) is defined as the mass ratio \(m_t / m_0\). 

The force on the transducer \(F_t\) can be approximated to be zero if the experimental apparatus is well-built, since the influence of GW onto such a small mass will be negligible.

If we apply an impulsive force in the form \(F_0 = a_0 \delta (t)\) we will see a response which can be calculated directly from the transfer function: for the two oscillators we find 
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (\omega ) &= a_0 \frac{\omega_{t}^2 - \omega^2}{(\omega^2 - \omega^2_{+} ) (\omega^2- \omega^2_{-})}  \\
\xi_{t} (\omega ) &= a_0 \frac{\omega_{t}^2}{(\omega^2 - \omega^2_{+}) (\omega^2- \omega^2_{-})}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\omega_{\pm}\) are the solutions (in terms of \(\omega \)) of 
%
\begin{align}
\omega^4 - (\omega^2_{0} + (1+\mu )\omega_{t}^2) \omega^2 + \omega_0^2 \omega_t^2 = 0
\,,
\end{align}
%
so the response of this coupled system has \textbf{two resonant frequencies}, and with the aid of the Cauchy residue theorem we can calculate the temporal form of the solution, a linear combination of sinusouds at \(\omega_{\pm}\) \cite[eqs.\ 8.79--80]{maggioreGravitationalWavesVolume2007}, for both oscillators.

We need to tune the bar so that its resonant frequency is the same as the one of the other bar: then we will get a \textbf{resonant transducer}, and the resonant frequencies will be 
%
\begin{align}
\omega_{\pm} = \omega_0 \qty(1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{\mu }}{2} + \mathcal{O}(\mu ))= \omega_0 \pm \omega_{b}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and the temporal form of the two oscillations will be 
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (t) &\approx \frac{a_0 }{\omega_0} \sin(\omega_0 t) \cos(\omega_{b}t)  \\
\xi_t (t) &\approx - \frac{a_0 }{\omega_0 \sqrt{\mu }} \cos(\omega_0 t) \sin(\omega_{b} t)
\,,
\end{align}
%
which means (since they are out of phase) that \textbf{energy is transferred} back and forth between the two oscillators; but the amplitudes differ by a factor \(\sqrt{\mu }\): 
%
\begin{align}
A_t = \frac{A_0 }{\sqrt{\mu }}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we typically go as low as \(\mu \lesssim \num{e-4}\), if we go lower other noise sources dominate.
This amplitude ratio is the best we could get by \textbf{energy conservation}: the energy is proportional to \(m \omega^2 A^2\), so if we impose the energy being \emph{completely} transferred back and forth between the two oscillators we \(A_0^2 / A_t^2 = m_0 / m_t \), since \(\omega \) is the same for the two oscillators.

Still, this amplifies the signal at our desired frequency by two orders of magnitude!

The transfer function with a transducer, and introducing dissipation for both oscillators, looks like: 
%
\begin{align}
H_{h \to \xi_{t}} (\omega ) &= - \frac{2L}{\pi^2} \frac{\omega_0^2 \omega^2}{ (\omega^2 - \omega_{+}^2 + i \omega \overline{\gamma})(\omega^2 - \omega_{-}^2 + i \omega \overline{\gamma})}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\overline{\gamma} = (\gamma_0 + \gamma_{t}) / 2\).
This should be compared with \eqref{eq:transfer-function-resonant-bar-fundamental}: since now we have \emph{two} terms going to zero quadratically with \(\omega \to \omega_0 \) (at least near zero, because of the dissipation) the graph now has two peaks which are both higher than the single one we had before.  

\subsection{Thermal noise}

We saw that we can represent the stages of our processing by their transfer functions \(H_{i}(\omega )\). These are multiplied in the amplitude modulation, while we have to take the square modulus of their product if we want to compute the PSD: 
%
\begin{align}
y(\omega ) = x(\omega ) \prod_{i=1}^{n} H_i(\omega )
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
S_y(\omega ) = S_x(\omega ) \abs{\prod_{i=1}^{n} H_i(\omega )}^2
\,.
\end{align}
%

At each stage, though, we can get noise,
which is then processed by the later transfer functions: if we have three stages we will get 
%
\begin{align}
y &= H_3 \qty( H_2 \qty( H_1 \qty(x) + n_2) + n_3) + n_4  \\
&= H_1 H_2 H_3 x + H_2 H_3 n_2 + H_2 n_3 + n_4 
\,.
\end{align}

Now, from the output \(y\) we want to reverse-engineer the signal: this will give us a signal \(x'\), calculated as 
%
\begin{align}
x' = \frac{y}{H_1 H_2 H_3 } = 
x + \underbrace{\frac{n_4 }{H_1 H_2 H_3 }}_{x_{n_4}} + \underbrace{\frac{n_3 }{H_1 H_2  }}_{x_{n_3 }}
+ \underbrace{\frac{n_2}{H_1 }}_{x_{n_2 }}
\,.
\end{align}

A similar reasoning can be applied to the power spectral density: then we will find 
%
\begin{align}
S_{x_{n_2}} &= \frac{S_{n_2}}{\abs{H_1}^2} \\
S_{x_{n_3}} &= \frac{S_{n_3}}{\abs{H_1 H_2 }^2} \\
S_{x_{n_4}} &= \frac{S_{n_4}}{\abs{H_1 H_2 H_3 }^2} 
\,.
\end{align}

Within our assumptions the signal \(z(t)\) will also consist of the sum of  a deterministic part \(z_d(t)\) plus a stochastic, noisy part \(z_n(t)\).

We can model the thermal contribution as a stochastic force upon the oscillator, which is responsible both for the dissipation and fluctuations around the mean: we can then decompose it into a mean part and a zero-mean part,
%
\begin{align}
m_0 \ddot{x} + k_0 x = F _{\text{th}} = \underbrace{- m_0 \gamma_0 \dot{x}}_{= \expval{F _{\text{th}}}} + F _{\text{n, th}} 
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\expval{F _{\text{n, th}}} = 0\). This is called the \textbf{Nyquist force}, and we will just denote it as \(F _{\text{n, th}} = F(t)\). 

We can assume that thermal fluctuations are completely uncorrelated: they are due to billions of atomic interactions, so the process loses memory quickly --- instantaneously, for the time scales we are interested in: 
%
\begin{align}
\expval{F(t_1 ) F(t_2 )} = A_0 \delta (t_1 - t_2 )
\,,
\end{align}
%
for some constant \(A_0 \). 
This means that the noise is white noise: its PSD is constant in frequency.

Our harmonic oscillator can be written as 
%
\begin{align}
\ddot{\xi}_{0} + \gamma_0 \dot{\xi}_{0} + \omega_0^2 \xi_0 = \frac{F(t)}{m_0 }
\,,
\end{align}
%
which we can solve with a Green's function: 
%
\begin{align}
x(t) = \underbrace{x_0 (t)}_{\text{hom.\ sol.}}
+ \frac{1}{m_0 } \int_{-\infty }^{\infty } \dd{t'} G(t - t') F(t')  
\,,
\end{align}
%
where 
%
\begin{align}
G(t) = \frac{1}{\omega_0} \theta (t) \exp(- \frac{\gamma_0t}{2}) \sin(\omega_0  t)
\,
\end{align}
%
is the Green's function, the impulse response of our system. The theta function is included in order to respect causality.
Plugging this into the expression for the particular solution \(x(t)\)  we find: 
%
\begin{align}
x(t) = \frac{1}{m_0 \omega_0 } \int_{0}^{t} \dd{t'} \exp(- \frac{\gamma_0}{2} (t-t')) \sin(\omega_0 (t-t')) F(t')
\,.
\end{align}

Since \(F(t')\) corresponds to the completely-uncorrelated thermal noise, we can show by an explicit calculation that, as long as \(\gamma_0 \ll \omega_0 \) (which means that the characteristic time of dissipation is much longer than the resonant frequency's period):
%
\begin{align}
\expval{x^2(t)} &= \frac{A}{m_0 \omega_0 } \int_{0}^{t} \dd{u} e^{-\gamma_0 u} \sin^2(\omega_0 u) \\
&\approx \frac{A}{m_0^2 \omega_0^2} \qty(1 - e^{- \gamma_0 t})
\,,
\end{align}
%
since when we write out the average of \(x^2\) we find the average of the product of two copies of \(F\), yielding a delta-function.
The average energy of the mode is in general given by 
%
\begin{align}
\expval{E(t)} 
= \frac{1}{2} m_0 \omega_0^2 \expval{x^2(t)} + \frac{1}{2} m_0 \expval{\dot{x}^2(t)}
\approx \frac{A}{2 m_0 \gamma_0 } \qty(1 - e^{-\gamma_0 t})
\,.
\end{align}

If the mode starts out with zero energy and then is immersed in a thermal bath with temperature \(T\), then by the equipartition theorem each of its quadratic degrees of freedom will gain an energy \(k_B T /2\): so, the average energy will asymptotically approach
%
\begin{align}
\expval{E(t)} \to \frac{1}{2} k_B T + \frac{1}{2} k_B T = k_B T 
\,,
\end{align}
%
which means that the normalization constant \(A\) must satisfy 
%
\begin{align}
k_B T = \frac{A}{2 m_0 \gamma_0 } \implies A = 2 k_B T m_0 \gamma_0 
\,.
\end{align}
%

\subsection{The Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem}

The Power Spectral Density is defined as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation (times two, since we are computing it single-sided): 
%
\begin{align}
S_F(\omega ) = 2 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd{t'} \expval{F(t) F(t')} e^{i \omega (t - t')} = 2 A \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd{\tau } \delta(\tau ) e^{i \omega \tau } = 2A 
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\tau  = t - t'\). Since we know the expression for \(A\), this tells us that the PSD of the noise is flat, and equal to: 
%
\begin{align}
S_F(\omega ) = 4 k_B T m_0 \gamma_0 
\,.
\end{align}

For a generic linear system, we can express the spectral shape of the force as a multiple of the velocity's spectral shape: 
%
\begin{align}
F(\omega ) = Z(\omega ) \dot{x}(\omega )
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(Z\) is called the \textbf{impedance} of the system. The electrical analog of this is the law relating the voltage and current: \(V(\omega ) = Z(\omega ) I(\omega )\).

The \textbf{Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem} tells us that the single-sided power spectral density of the force which is due to fluctuations is given in terms of the impedance of the system as:
%
\boxalign{
\begin{align}
S _{\text{F, th}} (\omega ) = 4 k_B T \Re{Z(\omega )}
\,.
\end{align}}

Note that taking the real part of \(Z\) means considering the \emph{imaginary} term in the equation of motion: the real part of \(Z\) quantifies the dissipation. 
% In our case 
% %
% \begin{align}
% S_F(\omega ) = 4 k_B T m_0 \gamma_0 
% \,.
% \end{align}

% We can always write 
% %
% \begin{align}
% F(\omega ) = Z(\omega ) \dot{x}(\omega )
% \,,
% \end{align}
% %
% for any linear system.
% So, the FDT gives us 
% This is in terms of the PSD of the force, which can be connected to that of the velocity.

The velocity in the linear system law can be written as \(\dot{x}(\omega) = i \omega x(\omega )\), so by the transformation law of the PSD under the application of a ``transfer function'' (which is \(i \omega \) in this case) we find 
%
\begin{align}
S_{x, \text{th}} (\omega ) = \frac{S_{\dot{x}, \text{th}}}{\abs{i \omega }^2} 
= \frac{S _{\text{F, th}} (\omega )}{\omega^2 \abs{Z(\omega )}^2}
= \frac{4 k_B T}{\omega^2} \frac{\Re{Z(\omega )}}{\abs{Z(\omega )}^2} 
\,.
\end{align}

This result quantifies the thermal noise we get when we reverse-engineer the original signal, as opposed to the noise in the output.

The energy of the DoF must be asymptotically constant and equal to \(k_B T /2\), but we have dissipation! Since the system is in thermal equilibrium, there is a pumping mechanism providing the energy which is lost to dissipation --- this is a force, and it creates noise! 
The higher the dissipation, the harder this force needs to push, so the noise increases accordingly. 

Another way to see it is that the loss term quantifies the ``conductance'' of energy between the thermal bath and the oscillator, so if it is low the time needed to transfer energy from the noisy thermal bath to the oscillator is very long. 

In real resonant-bar detectors, the temperatures are of the order of milliKelvin: we cool them to close to zero by isolating them and making liquid helium go through everything. 
In this case the approximation of constant temperature is quite good.

\subsubsection{Thermal noise examples}

For an electrical circuit, we have \(Z(\omega ) \equiv R\), therefore \(S_{V, \text{th}} (\omega ) = 4 k_B T R\). 

The equivalent of \(x\) in this context is the charge \(Q\), so that \(I(\omega ) = \dot{Q}(\omega )\). Its PSD contribution due to thermal noise will be 
%
\begin{align}
S _{\text{Q, th}} (\omega ) = \frac{4 k_B T}{\omega^2} \frac{\Re{Z(\omega )}}{\abs{Z(\omega )}^2} = \frac{4 k_B T}{\omega^2 R}
\,,
\end{align}
%
therefore the noise on the current \(I(\omega ) = \dot{Q} (\omega )\) will be 
%
\begin{align}
S _{\text{I, th}} (\omega ) = \omega^2 S _{\text{Q, th}} (\omega ) = \frac{4 k_B T}{R}
\,.
