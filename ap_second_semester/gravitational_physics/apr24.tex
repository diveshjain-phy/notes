Resonant bars are resonant: their transfer function is very much peaked. 

The transfer function is the response to the strain as a function of signal frequency.

The displacement function \(\xi_0 \) is a sinusoid, it looks like 
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (t) = \frac{2 L \omega^2 h_0 }{\pi^2} \frac{(\omega^2 - \omega^2_{0}) \cos(\omega t) - \gamma_0 \sin(\omega t)}{(\omega^2-\omega_0^2)^2 + \omega^2 \gamma_0^2}
\,.
\end{align}

In Fourier space this is easier: 
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (\omega ) = - \frac{2L}{\pi^2} \frac{\omega^2}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - i \omega \gamma_0 } h_0 \delta (\omega )
\,.
\end{align}

It is a fact from classical mechanics that the absorbed energy of an oscillator subject to an external impulsive force is 
%
\begin{align}
E 
= \frac{1}{2 m_0 } \abs{ \int_{ - \infty }^{ \infty  } F(t) e^{-i \omega_0 t} \dd{t}}^2
= \frac{ML^2}{\pi^{4} } \abs{ \int_{ - \infty }^{ \infty  } \ddot{h}_{xx}^{TT}(t) e^{-i \omega_0 t} \dd{t}}^2
\,,
\end{align}
%
and since the force is impulsive we can integrate by parts twice: so, we get 
%
\begin{align}
E = 16 M L^2 f_0^{4} \abs{h_{xx}^{TT} (f_0 )}^2
\,,
\end{align}
%
which is the energy of the GW component at frequency \(\omega_0 \): we can invert it as 
%
\begin{align}
\abs{h_{xx}^{TT} (f_0 )}^2 = \frac{1}{16L^2 f_0^{4}} \frac{E}{M}
\,.
\end{align}

The transfer function can be written as 
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (\omega ) = - \frac{2L}{\pi^2} \frac{\omega^2}{(\omega - \omega_{+}) (\omega-\omega_{-})} h^{TT}_{xx} (\omega )
\qquad \text{where} \qquad
\omega_{\pm} = \pm \sqrt{\omega_0 ^2 - \qty(\frac{\gamma_0 }{2})^2} - i \frac{\gamma_0 }{2}
\,.
\end{align}

We suppose that the incoming burst is a delta in time: then, it has components at all possible frequencies.

Then, we get 
%
\begin{align}
\xi_0 (t) = \frac{2L}{\pi^2} h_0 \tau_{GW} \int_{- \infty }^{ \infty } \frac{ \dd{\omega }}{2 \pi } \frac{\omega^2}{(\omega - \omega_{+}) (\omega-\omega_{-})} e^{-i \omega t} \approx \frac{2L }{\pi^2} h_0 \omega_0 \tau_{GW} e^{-\gamma_0 t / 2} \sin(\omega_0 t)
\,.
\end{align}

By saying that the signal is a delta, do we mean that \(\tau_{GW} \ll 1 / \omega_0 \)? YES, where \(\omega_0 \) is the frequency of the oscillator, which in our case is faster than the characteristic frequency of the dissipation. 

\subsection{Antenna pattern}

The sensitivity of the detector depends both on the direction from which che GW comes and the polarization.

Specifically, if \(\vec{J}\) is the orientation of the bar, then we have 
%
\begin{align}
h _{\text{out}} = \hat{J}^{i} \hat{J}^{j} h_{ij} (t)
\,.
\end{align}

If \(\theta \) is the angle between the bar direction and the source-Earth vector, we will have 
%
\begin{align}
h _{\text{out}} = h_{+} \sin^2\theta 
\,.
\end{align}

For a generic rotation, including a rotation of angle \(\varphi \) around the axis \(z'\) of the source system where the \(+\) and \(\times \) polarizations are defined, we get 
%
\begin{align}
h _{\text{out}} (t) = h_{+}' \sin^2\theta \cos 2 \varphi + h_{ \times }' \sin^2 \theta \sin 2 \varphi 
\,.
\end{align}

The response of the bar is quite small: we cannot really measure it; however we can transfer the energy to a lighter oscillator, which will move more. 

We need to tune the bar so that its resonant frequency is the same as the one of the other bar. 

The ratio of masses is \(\mu \), then we will have 
%
\begin{align}
A_t = \frac{A_0 }{\sqrt{\mu }}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we typically can choose \(\mu \lesssim \num{e-4}\), if we go lower other noise sources dominate.

\subsection{Thermal and readout noise}

We saw that we can represent the stages of our processing by their transfer functions \(H_{i}(\omega )\). At each stage, though, we can get noise.

This noise is then processed by the later transfer functions. 

Say we have 
%
\begin{align}
y(\omega ) = H_1 (\omega ) H_2 (\omega ) H_3 (\omega ) x(\omega )
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we have noise after each stage. 

We can have thermal noise: noisy signals are described by a deterministic part plus a stochastic noisy part.

We can model this thermal noise using a Green's function: we get 
%
\begin{align}
x(t) = \dots
\,.
\end{align}

For thermal noise, we can assume that it is completely uncorrelated: it is due to billions of atomic interactions, so it loses memory quickly.
This means that the noise is white noise: the PSD is constant in freqency. Therefore, we can show that 
%
\begin{align}
\expval{x^2(t)} \approx \frac{A}{m_0^2 \omega_0^2} \qty(1 - e^{- \gamma_0 t})
\,.
\end{align}

Then, the average total energy of the mode is 
%
\begin{align}
\expval{E(t)} 
= \frac{1}{2} m_0 \omega_0^2 \expval{x^2(t)} + \frac{1}{2} m_0 \expval{\dot{x}^2(t)}
\approx \frac{A}{2 m_0 \gamma_0 } \qty(1 - e^{-\gamma_0 t})
\,.
\end{align}

So, we get asymptotically 
%
\begin{align}
\expval{E(t)} \to 2 k_B T m_0 \gamma_0 
\,,
\end{align}
%
which is the fluctuation-dissipation theorem: the PSD of the noise is 
%
\begin{align}
S_F(\omega ) = 4 k_B T m_0 \gamma_0 
\,.
\end{align}

We can always write 
%
\begin{align}
F(\omega ) = Z(\omega ) \dot{x}(\omega )
\,,
\end{align}
%
for any linear system.
So, the FDT gives us 
%
\begin{align}
S _{\text{F, th}} (\omega ) = 4 k_B T \Re{Z(\omega )}
\,.
\end{align}

This is in terms of the PSD of the force, which can be connected to that of the velocity.

If the energy of the DoF must be asymptotically constant, there needs to be a lossy mechanism giving energy to the DoF.

The temperatures are of the order of milliKelvin, we cool them to close to zero by isolating them and making liquid helium go through everything. 

In this case the approximation of constant temperature is quite good.
