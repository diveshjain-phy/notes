Here are the notes I am taking during the lectures of the degree in [Astrophysics and Cosmology](http://astrophysics-and-cosmology.dfa.unipd.it/) at the university of Padua (in the theoretical curriculum).

They are divided by semester and class.
In every class folder there is a main file but the lectures are kept in a separate file for each day.
These can be compiled individually (with `pdflatex`), but the resulting PDFs are ignored by git to have some order: only the main pdf for each class is committed here; I should remember to compile it often but sometimes it might be out of date.

This repo is also synced with an Overleaf folder, however I think it is best if that one is kept private.
