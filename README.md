Here are the notes I am taking during the lectures of the degree in [Astrophysics and Cosmology](http://astrophysics-and-cosmology.dfa.unipd.it/) at the university of Padua (in the theoretical curriculum).

They are divided by semester and class: the current semester folder is `ap_first_semester`, containing notes for:

* [Advanced astrophysics](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/001PD/SCP9086382/N0)
* [Astrophysical (high energy) laboratory](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP9086379/A1302)
* [Mathematical and numerical methods](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP7081661/N0)
* [General Relativity](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP7081661/N0)
* [Fundamental of Astrophysics and Cosmology](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP9086381/N0)

In every class folder there is a main file but the lectures are kept in a separate file for each day, labelled with the date.
These can be compiled individually (with `pdflatex`), but the resulting PDFs are ignored by git to have some order: only the main pdf for each class is committed here; I should remember to compile it often but sometimes it might be out of date.

This repo is also synced with an Overleaf folder, however I think it is best if that one is kept private.

The idea for these notes is that they will be complete if somewhat untidy, while in the revision phase I will try to make them into a customized explaination, which will be put in the repository [Handbooks](https://github.com/jacopok/handbooks).

Besides the lecture notes, solutions for the exercises (for now, in the General Relativity class) are also present in this repository. Some python visualization of parts of the exercises will also be present when applicable, thanks to [Alessandro Lovo](https://github.com/AlessandroLovo).
Corrections and work on the exercises and notes is also done with the collaboration of Giorgio Mentasti.

Any observations,  suggestions and corrections are welcome.
They can be submitted as issues or pull requests here, or you can just send me an email at jacopo@tissino.it, or just send me a message.
